Magnetic And Gravity Anomaly Patterns Related To Hydrocarbon Fields In Northern West Siberia,"A study of the features of gravity and magnetic fields in the vicinity of oil and gas reservoirs in West Siberia demonstrated a spatial relationship with the hydrocarbon deposits. The relevant magnetic and gravity anomalies cover approximately 900000km2 in northern West Siberia. Amplitude and frequency were investigated initially using double Fourier spectrum (DFS) analysis. This was followed by (1) application of transformations, filtering, and ""moving windows"" analysis; (2) compilation of maps of regional and local anomalies, and potential field derivatives; and (3) investigation of the distribution of parameters in areas of known deposits. Hydrocarbon deposits are located mostly at the slopes of positive regional gravity and magnetic anomalies which are interpreted as relating to deep riftogenic structures. At the same time, it is established that the location of hydrocarbon depositions coincides commonly with local gravity and magnetic minima generated by lows in basement density and magnetization. All known hydrocarbon deposits in northern West Siberia are in areas characterized by comparatively high gradients of constituent of gravity anomalies with a wavelength of about 90–100 km. These newly revealed links between reservoirs and potential field parameters may be a means to predict new discoveries in poorly explored territories and seas, primarily in Russia's Arctic shelf.",10.1190/1.1444192
Inversion For Permeability Distribution From Time-Lapse Gravity Data,"Understanding reservoir properties plays a key role in managing a reservoir's resources and optimizing production. History matching is an important means for characterizing those properties. We developed a method to invert for the distribution of permeability directly from time-lapse gravity data. In this process, we used fluid flow in a porous medium coupled with forward modeling of the time-lapse gravity response as the forward operator, and then we solved a nonlinear inversion to reconstruct the permeability distribution in the reservoir. We were able to formulate the deterministic inversion as a Tikhonov regularization problem because of the relatively low computational cost of forward modeling time-lapse gravity data. The inversion can combine the information from time-lapse gravity and injection-production data sets to determine a static state of the reservoir described by the permeability. The resulting model satisfied all data sets simultaneously while obeying the mechanics of fluid flow through a porous medium. The inverse formulation also enabled the estimation of the uncertainty of the constructed permeability model with respect to the data, and our numerical simulations indicated that the information content in the two dynamic data sets appeared to be sufficiently high to constrain the recovery of permeability distribution.",10.1190/geo2014-0203.1
Quantifying Background Magnetic-Field Inhomogeneity For Improved Interpretation Of Free Induction Decay Measurements,"Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements provide useful insight into pore-scale properties of porous media. One influence affecting the measurement is inhomogeneity in the static background magnetic field (B0). This inhomogeneity can significantly alter the relaxation signal and potentially obscure pore-scale information. To improve the understanding of this effect on the free-induction decay (FID), a measurement still commonly used in practice, a novel methodology is developed to estimate the statistical distribution of B0. A suite of preparatory pulse sequences is developed to encode information about the B0 field in the initial amplitude and phase of the FID following each sequence and an inversion is employed to predict the statistical distribution of B0. Knowledge of the B0 distribution is then used to correct for the impact of B0 inhomogeneity on the FID measurement; this is essential for improving the usefulness of FID measurements for the estimation of pore-scale properties. Results are presented for both numerical and laboratory studies verifying the feasibility of the developed methodology in a controlled laboratory environment, and demonstrating that knowledge of the statistical distribution of B0 is sufficient to estimate the impact of B0 inhomogeneity on the FID in cases where B0 inhomogeneity causes less than an order of magnitude decrease in the relaxation times governing the FID.",10.1190/geo2012-0488.1
Families Of Salt Domes In The Gulf Coastal Province,"If two fluids of different densities are superposed one over the other, the plane interface between the two fluids becomes unstable if the heavy fluid overlays the lighter one. This type of hydrodynamic instability is called Rayleigh‐Taylor instability. The theory of Rayleigh‐Taylor instability is a useful tool to study the distribution of salt domes in the coastal region of the Gulf Coastal Province. In spite of a drastic simplification of the geologic situation, the model shows: a) that the spacing of salt domes about an initial disturtbance depends upon the thickness of the mother salt and viscosity ratio of overlying sediment to salt; b) that domes not only grow upward from the initial disturbance, but domes are also triggered in the vicinity of the primary disturbance, forming a family of incipient domes with a regular pattern; c) that the family of incipient domes develops out of the initial disturbance starting at the location of maximal instability and spreading radially. Several numerical examples provide a framework for examining the disturbance of Gulf Coastal salt domes.",10.1190/1.1439806
Attribute-Guided Well-Log Interpolation Applied To Low-Frequency Impedance Estimation,"Several approaches exist to use trends in 3D seismic data, in the form of seismic attributes, to interpolate sparsely sampled well-log measurements between well locations. Kriging and neural networks are two such approaches. We have applied a method that finds a relation between seismic attributes (such as two-way times, interval velocities, reflector roughness) and rock properties (in this case, acoustic impedance) from information at well locations. The relation is designed for optimum prediction of acoustic impedances away from well sites, and this is accomplished through a combination of cross validation and the Tikhonov-regularized least-squares method. The method is fast, works well even for highly underdetermined problems, and has general applicability. We apply it to two case studies in which we estimate 3D cubes of low-frequency impedance, which is essential for producing good porosity models. We show that the method is superior to traditional least squares: Numerous blind tests show that estimated low-frequency impedance away from well locations can be determined with an accuracy very close to estimations obtained at well locations.",10.1190/1.2996302
The Csm Test Area For Electrical Surveying Methods,"Testing of geophysical equipment and methods over a region of known geology has long been considered desirable if not actually necessary. It is the purpose of this note to bring to the attention of the geophysical community the development of a test area for the evaluation of electrical prospecting methods. The test area is a strip, 19 km broad and 280 km long, made up of the tiers of townships 1N and 2N stretching between R42W and R70W in eastern Colorado (Figure 1). Access to the strip is easy as the area is relatively level and county roads border most sections; population is sparse.",10.1190/1.1439962
"Integrated Vti Model Building With Seismic Data, Geologic Information, And Rock-Physics Modeling — Part 1: Theory And Synthetic Test","Seismic anisotropy plays an important role in structural imaging and lithologic interpretation. However, anisotropic model building is a challenging underdetermined inverse problem. It is well-understood that single component pressure wave seismic data recorded on the upper surface are insufficient to resolve a unique solution for velocity and anisotropy parameters. To overcome the limitations of seismic data, we have developed an integrated model building scheme based on Bayesian inference to consider seismic data, geologic information, and rock-physics knowledge simultaneously. We have performed the prestack seismic inversion using wave-equation migration velocity analysis (WEMVA) for vertical transverse isotropic (VTI) models. This image-space method enabled automatic geologic interpretation. We have integrated the geologic information as spatial model correlations, applied on each parameter individually. We integrate the rock-physics information as lithologic model correlations, bringing additional information, so that the parameters weakly constrained by seismic are updated as well as the strongly constrained parameters. The constraints provided by the additional information help the inversion converge faster, mitigate the ambiguities among the parameters, and yield VTI models that were consistent with the underlying geologic and lithologic assumptions. We have developed the theoretical framework for the proposed integrated WEMVA for VTI models and determined the added information contained in the regularization terms, especially the rock-physics constraints.",10.1190/geo2015-0592.1
Velocity Analysis Using Weighted Semblance,"Increasing the resolution of semblance-based velocity spectra, or semblance spectra, is useful for estimating normal moveout velocities, as increased resolution can help to distinguish peaks in the spectra. The resolution of semblance spectra depends on the sensitivity of semblance to changes in velocity. By weighting terms in the semblance calculation that are more sensitive to changes in velocity, we can increase resolution. Our implementation of weighted semblance is a straightforward extension of conventional semblance. Somewhat surprisingly, we increase resolution by choosing an offset-dependent weighting function that minimizes semblance. We test our method on synthetic and field data, and our tests confirm that weighted semblance provides higher resolution than conventional semblance.",10.1190/geo2011-0034.1
Seismic Velocities From Surface Measurements,"The purpose of this paper is to discuss field and interpretive techniques which permit, in favorable cases, the quite accurate determination of seismic interval velocities prior to drilling. A simple but accurate formula is developed for the quick calculation of interval velocities from ""average velocities"" determined by the known x2-T2 technique. To secure accuracy a careful study of multiple reflections is necessary and this is discussed. Although the principal objective in determining velocities is to allow an accurate structural interpretation to be made from seismic reflection data, an important secondary objective is to get some lithological information. This is obtained through a correlation of velocities with rock type and depth.",10.1190/1.1438126
Identification Of Thermal Conductivities By Temperature Gradient Profiles: One‐Dimensional Steady Flow,"The comparison model method (CMM) is applied to the identification of spatially varying thermal conductivity in a one‐dimensional domain. This method deals with the discretized steady‐state heat equation written at the nodes of a lattice, a lattice which models a stack of plane parallel layers. The required data are temperature gradient and heat source (or sink) values. The unknowns of this inverse problem are not nodal values but internode thermal conductivities, which appear in the node heat balance equation. The conductivities, e.g., the solutions to the inverse problem obtained by the CMM, are a one‐parameter family. In order to achieve uniqueness (which coincides with identifiability in this case), a suitable value of this parameter must be found. To this end we consider (1) parameterization, i.e., introducing equality constraints between the unknown coefficients, (2) the use of two data sets at least in a subdomain, and (3) self‐identifiability. Each of these items formally translates the available a priori information about the system, e.g., geophysical properties of the layers. Under the assumption that an admissible solution exists, we evaluate the effects on the solution of two types of data noise: additive noise affecting temperature and a kind of multiplicative noise affecting heat‐source terms. In the numerical examples we provide, parameterization is combined with the CMM in order to obtain the unique solution to a test inverse problem, the geophysical data of which come from a well drilled across Tertiary layers in central Italy. Finally, we consider data perturbed by pseudorandom noise. More precisely, we add noise to temperature gradients and obtain stability estimates which correctly predict the numerical results. In particular, if the layers where the parameterization constraint applies contain a strong source term (e.g., due to flowing water), the solution is relatively insensitive to noise. Also, for multiplicative noise affecting heat‐source terms, theoretical stability predictions are confirmed numerically. The main advantage of the CMM is its simple algebraic formulation. Its implementation in the field by means of a pocket calculator allows both a consistency check on the data being collected and estimates of the unknown values of conductivity.",10.1190/1.1442691
On The Imaging Of Reflectors In The Earth,"In this paper, I present a modification of the Beylkin inversion operator. This modification accounts for the band‐limited nature of the data and makes the role of discontinuities in the sound speed more precise. The inversion presented here partially dispenses with the small‐parameter constraint of the Born approximation. This is shown by applying the proposed inversion operator to upward scattered data represented by the Kirchhoff approximation, using the angularly dependent geometrical‐optics reflection coefficient. A fully nonlinear estimate of the jump in sound speed may be extracted from the output of this algorithm interpreted in the context of these Kirchhoff‐approximate data for the forward problem. The inversion of these data involves integration over the source‐receiver surface, the reflecting surface, and frequency. The spatial integrals are computed by the method of stationary phase. The output is asymptotically a scaled singular function of the reflecting surface. The singular function of a surface is a Dirac delta function whose support is on the surface. Thus, knowledge of the singular functions is equivalent to mathematical imaging of the reflector. The scale factor multiplying the singular function is proportional to the geometrical‐optics reflection coefficient. In addition to its dependence on the variations in sound speed, this reflection coefficient depends on an opening angle between rays from a source and receiver pair to the reflector. I show how to determine this unknown angle. With the angle determined, the reflection coefficient contains only the sound speed below the reflector as an unknown, and it can be determined. A recursive application of the inversion formalism is possible. That is, starting from the upper surface, each time a major reflector is imaged, the background sound speed is updated to account for the new information and data are processed deeper into the section until a new major reflector is imaged. Hence, the present inversion formalism lends itself to this type of recursive implementation. The inversion proposed here takes the form of a Kirchhoff migration of filtered data traces, with the space‐domain amplitude and frequency‐domain filter deduced from the inversion theory. Thus, one could view this type of inversion and parameter estimation as a Kirchhoff migration with careful attention to amplitude.",10.1190/1.1442363
Fault Slicing—A New Approach To The Interpretation Of Fault Detail,"The manner in which a fault intersects a hydrocarbon reservoir affects production characteristics and thus must be understood in great detail. A 3-D seismic data volume can be sliced interactively to yield seismic sections parallel to a fault plane. These fault slices can then be used in several ways for the study of faults. Tracking of correlative horizons on fault slices provides a map of fault throw and permits study of the throw as a function of vertical traveltime and horizontal position. Because a fault slice remains within one major fault block, the study of growth relationships in that block is facilitated. Splinter faults, which are also significant in development and production, can be studied effectively on fault slices because of the uniform proximity of these sections to the parent fault. We conclude that there is some uniformity in azimuth between splinter faults and their parent.",10.1190/1.1442245
A Total Field Magnetometer For Mobile Operation,"A magnetometer which measures the earth's total magnetic field is described. The detector or measuring element of the magnetometer contains three mutually perpendicular elements, two of which are utilized to orient the third, which in turn operates a recording device to record the total magnetic field. The detector elements are of the inductive type and do not require ferromagnetic material to give them the high sensitivity required in geophysical work. The presence of a magnetic field in the region of the detector causes alternating currents to be generated in the detector elements. These currents are amplified to actuate motors which control the orienting and neutralizing functions of the magnetometer. A tape recorder gives continuous field readings. The accuracy of the magnetic data taken is better than five gammas.",10.1190/1.1437393
Kinematics Of Crossline Prestack Migration,"Among the reasons for considering optional seismic processes such as dip moveout (DMO) or prestack migration is the fact that two reflections with the same arrival time may require different stacking velocities in order to produce an acceptable image. For example, inline dip tends to increase the required stacking velocity, and DMO can be applied to correct this effect. Crossline dip has no direct effect on stacking velocity, but, because average velocity tends to increase with depth, a dipping reflection broadside to a seismic line will tend to require a lower stacking velocity than an in‐plane reflection with the same time of arrival. This problem is not addressed by DMO, but it can be handled by what I call ""crossline prestack migration.""",10.1190/1.1442978
A Comparison Of Seismic Trace Summing Techniques,"The results of an analysis and comparison of mantissa only, sign bit, true amplitude, automatic volume control, and diversity stack signal trace summations are presented. The results show that under conditions frequently encountered for low‐level sources, all these summation methods preserve the fidelity of input signals to within a time variant scale factor. The value of the signal‐to‐noise (S/N) average power ratio of the true amplitude summer is shown to be much more sensitive to intertrace noise variance differences than the other summing techniques. Excessive signal distortion may occur for mantissa only or sign bit summers when instantaneous input signal magnitude is large in comparison with the input noise standard deviations of the summed data. There will be no significant differences in the performance of mantissa only and sign bit summers under conditions frequently encountered for low‐level sources. The effects of signal summation methods are not directly dependent upon any instantaneous gain ranging characteristics of the amplifier used to create the input data.",10.1190/1.1441104
A Comparison Of Electromagnetic Exploration Systems,"Electromagnetic (EM) exploration systems fall into three distinct classes, (1) frequency domain, (2) impulse response, and (3) step response, and have overall frequency responses that approximate f+1, f0, and f-1. To examine further these three classes, the transfer function of a frequency‐domain system, and the step and impulse response functions of ideal time‐domain EM systems (TEM), are derived in terms of a single set of target‐specific parameters. The inductive time constants of practical exploration targets extend over three orders of magnitude, imposing severe constraints on practical exploration systems. Field data demonstrate that the impulse TEM response from a conductive half‐space may show a 100‐fold spatial variability at early times (≲1 ms) and then will decrease to a two‐fold variability at late times ( ⩾4 ms). This differential variability influences the ability of an EM system to detect an exploration target. For a half‐space where the impulse response varies as t-k, an inductive target of time constant τ exhibits the greatest contrast to the half‐space at a delay time of kτ for an impulse‐response system, and at (k-1)τ for a step‐response system.",10.1190/1.1442133
Static Image Principle For Anisotropic‐Conducting Half‐Space Problems: Pec And Pmc Boundaries,"The image principle for an isotropic half‐space bounded by perfect electric conductor (PEC) or perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) plane is presented in most elementary textbooks on electromagnetics. It is perhaps not so well known that this principle can also be generalized to anisotropic media in the static case, because it is not covered in leading monographs of geoelectromagnetics (Wait, 1982; Negi and Saraf, 1989; Eskola, 1992). The anisotropic image method can be applied to geologic media that exhibit anisotropic electrical conductivity caused by the fractures and fissures in the rock. Such structures are important in the sites for disposal of nuclear waste. The characterization of these structures by electrical geophysical methods is very essential because they form the main paths for groundwater flow. The air‐ground boundary can be treated as a PMC plane representing the nonconducting medium. Otherwise the medium is assumed to be linear (ohmic) and homogeneous in terms of electrical conductivity. The image method presented is also relevant to problems arising in the traditional ore prospecting where a conducting ore body buried in an electrically anisotropic host rock generates secondary electric fields (Asten, 1974; Eloranta, 1988).",10.1190/1.1443401
Toward Continuous 4D Microgravity Monitoring Of Volcanoes,"Four-dimensional or time-lapse microgravity monitoring has been used effectively on volcanoes for decades to characterize the changes in subsurface volcanic systems. With measurements typically lasting from a few days to weeks and then repeated a year later, the spatial resolution of theses studies is often at the expense of temporal resolution and vice versa. Continuous gravity studies with one to two instruments operating for a short period of time (weeks to months) have shown enticing evidence of very rapid changes in the volcanic plumbing system (minutes to hours) and in one case precursory signals leading to eruptive activity were detected. The need for true multi-instrument networks is clear if we are to have both the temporal and spatial reso-lution needed for effective volcano monitoring. However, the high cost of these instruments is currently limiting the implementation of continuous microgravity networks. An interim approach to consider is the development of a collaborative network of researchers able to bring multiple instruments together at key volcanoes to investigate multitemporal physical changes in a few type volcanoes. However, to truly move forward, it is imperative that new low-cost instruments are developed to increase the number of instruments available at a single site. Only in this way can both the temporal and spatial integrity of monitoring be maintained. Integration of these instruments into a multiparameter network of continuously recording sensors is essential for effective volcano monitoring and hazard mitigation.",10.1190/1.2981185
Fracture Detection Using Crosswell And Single Well Surveys,"We recorded high‐resolution (1 to 10 kHz), crosswell and single well seismic data in a shallow (15 to 35 m), water‐saturated, fractured limestone sequence at Conoco's borehole test facility near Newkirk, Oklahoma. Our objective was to develop seismic methodologies for imaging gas‐filled fractures in naturally fractured gas reservoirs. The crosswell (1/4 m receiver spacing, 50 to 100 m well separation) surveys used a piezoelectric source and hydrophones before, during, and after an air injection that we designed to displace water from a fracture zone. Our intent was to increase the visibility of the fracture zone to seismic imaging and to confirm previous hydrologic data that indicated a preferred pathway. For the single well seismic imaging (a piezoelectric source and an eight‐element hydrophone array at 1/4 m spacing), we also recorded data before and after the air injection. The crosswell results indicate that the air did follow a preferred pathway that was predicted by hydrologic modeling. In addition, the single well seismic imaging using vertical common depth‐point (CDP) gathers indicated an anomaly consistent with the anomaly location of crosswell and hydrologic inversion results. Following the field tests, a slant well was drilled and cored to confirm the existence and nature of the rock associated with the seismic anomalies. A vertical fracture was intersected within less than 1 m of where the seismic results had predicted.",10.1190/1.1444160
Multiscale Deformable-Layer Tomography,"Traveltime tomography relies on broad ray-angle coverage to constrain the spatial location of velocity anomalies. When ray-angle coverage is narrow, cell or grid tomography can be plagued by smearing artifacts bearing imprints of the raypaths. Multiscale deformable-layer tomography (DLT), which inverts for the geometry of velocity interfaces instead of velocity, can be more effective than grid-based tomography in mitigating such artifacts, especially when velocity values are known for parts of the model. The DLT model consists of geologically sensible layers represented by triangular prisms. In areas of good ray coverage, DLT can be used to invert simultaneously for layer velocities as well as interface geometry. Tests of synthetic models of crosswell refraction, 2D tomostatics, and 3D vertical seismic profiling (VSP) first-arrival data sets show that DLT can produce solutions superior to those produced by cell- or grid-based tomography.",10.1190/1.2194519
Temporal Geophysical Signatures From Contaminant-Mass Remediation,"We have previously documented changes in bulk electrical conductivity, self-potential (SP), and ground-penetrating-radar (GPR) reflections in a field setting caused by biogeochemical transformations of hydrocarbon-contaminated media. These transformations are associated with hydrocarbon biodegradation. The results of surface geophysical surveys acquired in 1996, 2003, and 2007 document changes in geophysical signatures associated with removing hydrocarbon mass in the contaminated zone. Initial investigations in 1996 showed that relative to background, the contaminated area was characterized by higher bulk electrical conductivity, positive SP anomaly, and attenuated GPR reflections. Repeated surveys in 2003 and 2007 over the contaminated area showed that in 2007, the bulk electrical conductivityhad reverted to near-background conditions, the positive SP anomaly became more negative, and the zone of attenuated GPR reflections showed increased signal strength. Removal of hydrocarbon mass in the vadose zone over the plume by a soil vapor-extraction system installed in 2001 was primarily responsible for the changing geophysical responses. Although chemical data from groundwater showed a   3-m  -thick con-ductive plume in 2007, the plume was not imaged by elec-trical resistivity. Forward modeling suggests that apparent bulk electrical conductivity of the saturated zone plume has to be three to five times higher than background values to be imaged by electrical resistivity. We suggest that removing hydrocarbon-contaminant-mass reduction by natural or engineered bioremediation can be imaged effectively by temporal geophysical surveys.",10.1190/1.3139769
Accuracy Of Heterogeneous Staggered-Grid Finite-Difference Modeling Of Rayleigh Waves,"Heterogeneous finite-difference (FD) modeling assumes that the boundary conditions of the elastic wavefield between material discontinuities are implicitly fulfilled by the distribution of the elastic parameters on the numerical grid. It is widely applied to weak elastic contrasts between geologic formations inside the earth. We test the accuracy at the free surface of the earth. The accuracy for modeling Rayleigh waves using the conventional standard staggered-grid (SSG) and the rotated staggered grid (RSG) is investigated. The accuracy tests reveal that one cannot rely on conventional numerical dispersion discretization criteria. A higher sampling is necessary to obtain acceptable accuracy. In the case of planar free surfaces aligned with the grid, 15 to 30 grid points per minimum wavelength of the Rayleigh wave are required. The widely used explicit boundary condition, the so-called image method, produces similar accuracy and requires approximately half the sampling of the wavefield compared to heterogeneous free-surface modeling. For a free-surface not aligned with the grid (surface topography), the error increases significantly and varies with the dip angle of the interface. For an irregular interface, the RSG scheme is more accurate than the SSG scheme. The RSG scheme, however, requires 60 grid points per minimum wavelength to achieve good accuracy for all dip angles. The high computation requirements for 3D simulations on such fine grids limit the application of heterogenous modeling in the presence of complex surface topography.",10.1190/1.2213051
Time-Domain Inversion Of Gpr Data Containing Attenuation Due To Conductive Losses,"Many seismic data processing and inversion techniques have been applied to ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data without including the wave field attenuation caused by conductive ground. Neglecting this attenuation often reduces inversion resolution. This paper introduces a GPR inversion technique that accounts for the effects of attenuation. The inversion is formulated in the time domain with the synthetic GPR waveforms calculated by a finite-element method (FEM). The Jacobian matrix can be computed efficiently with the same FEM forward modeling procedure. Synthetic data tests show that the inversion can generate high-resolution subsurface velocity profiles even with data containing strong random noise. The inversion can resolve small objects not readily visible in the waveforms. Further, the inversion yields a dielectric constant that can help to determine the types of material filling underground cavities.",10.1190/1.2335518
High‐Resolution Common‐Depth‐Point Reflection Profiling:Field Acquisition Parameter Design,"The results of a seismic reflection profiling exercise are strongly dependent upon parameters used in field recording. The choice of parameters is determined by objectives of the survey, available resources, and geologic locality. Some simple modeling and/or a walkaway noise survey are helpful in choice of field parameters. Filtering data before analog‐to‐digital conversion in the field can help overcome limitations in the dynamic range of the seismograph. Source and geophone arrays can be used to a limited extent in high‐resolution surveys to help attenuate ground roll. Proper planting of geophones can be an important factor in obtaining the flattest spectral response. Various seismic energy sources provide the flattest spectral response. Various seismic energy sources provide different spectral character and varying degrees of convenience and cost.",10.1190/1.1442088
2D Waveform Tomography Applied To Long-Streamer Mcs Data From The Scotian Slope,"Detailed velocity models of the earth's subsurface can be obtained through waveform tomography. The accuracy of the long-wavelength component of such velocity models, which is the background velocity field, is particularly sensitive to modeling low-frequency refracted waves that have long paths through target structures. Thus, field examples primarily have focused on the analysis of long-offset wide-angle data sets collected using autonomous receivers, in which refractions arrive at significantly earlier times than reflections. Modern marine acquisition with long streamers now offers the ability to record refracted waves with high spatial density and uniform source, both in shallow and deep water. We used 2D multichannel seismic (MCS) data acquired with a 9-km-long streamer over the Scotian Slope in water depths of ∼1600 m. The refracted arrivals, although mostly restricted to far-offset receivers, provided sufficient information to successfully invert for a high-resolution background velocity field. Using a frequency-domain acoustic code over frequencies from 8 to 24 Hz on two crossing profiles, we found that the limited refracted waves can constrain the velocity field above the depth of the turning waves (∼1.5 km below seafloor). Several important features were resolved by the waveform velocity model that were not present in the initial traveltime model. In particular, a high-velocity layer at 300 m below the seafloor, interpreted as gas hydrates, was imaged even where a characteristic bottom-simulating reflector was not visible. At 750-m depth, a strong velocity increase of 300 m/s existed beneath a gently dipping reflector along which low-velocity zones, possibly related to gas, were present. Velocity models were highly consistent at the crossing point between the two profiles. The depth extent of the MCS waveform tomography constrained by refractions could be extended by even longer streamers (e.g., 15 km) or by joint inversion with data from ocean-bottom seismographs.",10.1190/1.3587219
A Fourier Method For Borehole Electromagnetic Problems,"The induction logging problem is solved for a two‐coil sonde in a borehole surrounded by a bedding sequence which varies arbitrarily in the vertical direction. The solution is based on parallel computation of 500–1000 m of log data. Both the R and X components of the voltage log are modeled. The problem is solved in the spatial‐frequency domain in which a transfer function relates the anomalous borehole voltage for a two‐coil sonde to the conductivity spectrum of the formation, resulting in a natural extension of Doll's geometric factor theory. This computationally compact formulation does not require matrices and is designed as a computer aid for log analysts. The mathematical method (with proper conditioning) can efficiently solve the inverse problem of transforming the voltage induced in the receiving coil to a formation conductivity log. This paper establishes the forward method. Numerical results are given for beds of finite thickness for both brine‐ and oil‐base muds. The Fourier method is in good agreement with both a finite‐element method and a semi‐analytic method.",10.1190/1.1442173
Amplitude Preprocessing Of Single And Multicomponent Seismic Data,"Whenever the data acquisition is restricted to line surveys rather than areal surveys, seismic processing is necessarily in two dimensions. In this paper it is argued that two‐dimensional (2-D) processing is preferably applied after transforming the point source responses into line source responses. The effect of this transformation is a correction of the amplitudes in the data. For single‐component acoustic data as well as for multicomponent elastic data a line source response is nothing but a superposition of point source responses. Hence, in principle a line source response can be synthesized by integrating point source responses along the desired line source axis. In practice, however, this integration cannot be carried out due to the incompleteness of the data. It is shown that the integration along the source axis can be replaced by an integration along the receiver axis. The underlying assumption is that the wavefields exhibit a certain type of cylindrical symmetry. For horizontally layered acoustic and elastic media this assumption is fully satisfied. For 2-D inhomogeneous media this assumption is approximately satisfied, provided the data are sorted in CMP gathers. Having transformed the point source responses into line source responses, the results may be considered as ""true amplitude"" 2-D data. Hence, proceeding with existing 2-D seismic processing techniques is then justified.",10.1190/1.1443331
"Integrating 3-D Seismic Imaging And Seismic Attribute Analysis With Genetic Stratigraphy: Implications For Infield Reserve Growth And Field Extension, Budare Field, Venezuela","Despite being a mature oil producer, the Budare Field in the Eastern Venezuela Basin offers considerable reserve growth potential because of stratigraphic and structural complexity. Our ability to resolve these complexities was enhanced following acquisition in 1995 of a 3-D seismic data set over a large part of the field. The seismic data were tied by synthetic to well‐log data by several wells having sonic and density information and then integrated with the high‐resolution genetic stratigraphic framework established from well‐log correlations. Two key surfaces identified on the seismic data correlated directly to two stratigraphically defined sequence boundaries, maximum flooding surfaces (MFS) 80 and 100. A third seismic surface correlated approximately with the stratigraphically defined MFS 62. Collectively, these surfaces form fundamental control surfaces from which seismic attribute analysis and imaging from inverse modeling were undertaken. Four depositional trends detected by the seismic imaging and attribute analysis have important implications for reserve growth potential, guiding future field development. An incised valley, filled primarily with thick fluvial sandstones, was detected by mapping average seismic amplitudes between the MFS 62 and 80 markers, and several step‐out drilling locations were identified where the sandstones intersect structurally high positions. The distribution of thick distributary‐mouth‐bar facies, and moreover, the boundary with adjacent thin‐bedded strandplain facies, were similarly detected by mapping average seismic amplitudes in a 35-ms time window below MFS 80. The mouth‐bar facies coincide with the crestal position of a potentially large, structurally defined field extension supporting multiple potential infill wells. Several high‐negative‐amplitude anomalies coinciding with thick fluvial sandstones overlying MFS 62 display faulted boundaries and are interpreted as direct hydrocarbon indicators, providing obvious infill drilling locations, and finally, a marine ravinement surface separating the key oil‐producing reservoirs below MFS 80 was identified by seismic inversion.",10.1190/1.1444254
Induction Logging For Vertical Structures In The Presence Of A Borehole Fluid,"Mapping hydraulic fractures with borehole instrumentation presents many problems. The resulting fracture eddy currents can be expected to be smaller than the corresponding borehole fluid currents. The transmitting and receiver coils are vertical and are in close proximity to each other. This orientation is necessary to couple strongly to vertical structures and is much more difficult to analyze than the case of horizontal coils. The coils must be physically but not electrically isolated from probable hostile temperature and pressure environment. Analytic expressions are presented which predict the effect of the cavity, misalignment of the coils in the cavity, and an upper bound on the effect of the borehole fluid.",10.1190/1.1441141
Wavelengths Of Earth Structures That Can Be Resolved From Seismic Reflection Data,"The aim of inverting seismic waveforms is to obtain the ""best"" earth model. The best model is defined as the one producing seismograms that best match (usually under a least‐squares criterion) those recorded. Our approach is nonlinear in the sense that we synthesize seismograms without using any linearization of the elastic wave equation. Since we use rather complete data sets without any spatial aliasing, we do not have the problem of secondary minima (Tarantola, 1986). Nevertheless, our gradient methods fail to converge if the starting earth model is far from the true earth (Mora, 1987; Kolb et al., 1986; Pica et al., 1989).",10.1190/1.1442719
Gravity Source Moment Inversion: A Versatile Approach To Characterize Position And 3-D Orientation Of Anomalous Bodies,"We present a 3-D gravity interpretation method based on the inversion of source moments employing the series derived from the gravity anomaly expansion in multipoles and retaining moments up to second order only. It presents the advantages of being essentially linear and allowing a straightforward computer implementation. The method requires neither an explicit assumption about the source geometry nor a priori knowledge about the density contrast distribution, which may even be nonuniform. The method assumes implicitly: (1) that the source fits in the interior of an imaginary sphere whose center coincides with the source center of mass and whose radius is smaller than the depth to the source center of mass relative to the measuring plane, and (2) that the spatial density distribution presents three ortogonal planes of symmetry intersecting at the source center of mass. The first assumption can be met by upward continuing the observed anomaly. When both assumptions are met, the method produces reliable and stable estimates of the total anomalous mass, the coordinates of the center of mass, the three principal axes directions of the anomalous body, and the relative importance among the axes. The method is particularly suited for interpreting compact, isolated or disjoint, but spatially correlated sources. The method is sensitive to an incomplete removal of the regional field (presumably superimposed on the residual anomaly of interest) because the unremoved part of the regional field may strongly affect the estimates of the residual source moments.",10.1190/1.1443870
An Approximation For The Xu‐White Velocity Model,"In 1995, S. Xu and R. E. White described a method for estimating compressional and shear‐wave velocities of shaley sandstones from porosity and shale content. Their model was able to predict the effect of increasing clay content on compressional‐wave velocity observed in laboratory measurements. A key step in the Xu‐White method estimates dry rock bulk and shear moduli for the sand/shale mixture. This step is performed numerically by applying the differential effective medium method to the Kuster‐Toksöz equations for ellipsoidal pores. This step is computationally intensive. Using reasonable assumptions about dry rock elastic properties, this step can be replaced with a set of approximations for dry rock bulk and shear moduli. Numerical experiments show an extremely close match between velocities obtained with these approximations and velocities computed with the differential effective medium method. These approximations simplify the application of the Xu‐White method, and make the method computationally more efficient. They also provide insight into the Xu‐White method. For example, these approximations show how the Xu‐White model is related to the critical porosity model.",10.1190/1.1512786
Surface‐Related Multiple Elimination On Land Seismic Data—Strategies Via Case Studies,"Three processing strategies for the estimation and subsequent elimination of surface‐related multiple energy on land seismic data are presented. They can be applied in a prestack mode (to shot and common‐midpoint gathers) or in a poststack mode. The algorithm for the multiple attenuation is based on wave theoretical principles in which the data are used as a prediction operator. The estimated multiples are then adaptively subtracted from the input data to obtain primary‐only data. A processing step prior to applying multiple elimination is an important component of these methodologies, particularly in the prestack analysis. Its aim is to regularize the data, improve the S/N ratio, and balance the seismic amplitudes. This results in smooth prediction operators. The effectiveness of these schemes in suppressing multiples is demonstrated with a number of case studies involving processing land seismic data.",10.1190/1.1444771
"3D Seismic Attributes For A Tight Gas Sand Reservoir Characterization Of The Eastern Sulige Gas Field, Ordos Basin, China","The Lower Permian Xiashihezi Formation of the Ordos Basin is the largest producer of tight gas sand in China. The controls on tight gas production are many and include a variety of geologic, hydrodynamic, and engineering factors from one well to another throughout the basin. In this study, we considered data from a 408  km2 3D seismic volume and logs from 17 wells to investigate the geologic controls on gas production in the P1h8 member of the Xiashihezi Formation, eastern Sulige gas field, Ordos Basin. Our objective was to determine the potential of applying multiple seismic attributes to identify the higher productivity areas of a tight gas sand reservoir. To achieve this, we used amplitude, complex traces, spectral decomposition, and seismic attenuation attributes derived from the 3D seismic volume to detect gas-bearing sand areas. The results of seismic attribute analysis revealed that no single attribute is correlated to higher productivity areas. The qualitative correlations between attributes and production records reflected that higher productivity areas are associated with seismically definable higher amplitude, more stable phase, tuning frequency, and stronger attenuation features in the study area. Meanwhile, three outlier wells in the seismic attribute analysis provided a reminder of the uncertainty in geologic interpretation. The gas-sand reservoir evaluation results suggested that the Pareto principle helps to enhance the interpretation needed to determine the productivity distribution of P1h8 tight-gas reservoir in the study area.",10.1190/geo2014-0362.1
Quantitative Conductivity And Permittivity Estimation Using Full-Waveform Inversion Of On-Ground Gpr Data,"Conventional ray-based techniques for analyzing common-midpoint (CMP) ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data use part of the measured data and simplified approximations of the reality to return qualitative results with limited spatial resolution. Whereas these methods can give reliable values for the permittivity of the subsurface by employing only the phase information, the far-field approximations used to estimate the conductivity of the ground are not valid for near-surface on-ground GPR, such that the estimated conductivity values are not representative for the area of investigation. Full-waveform inversion overcomes these limitations by using an accurate forward modeling and inverts significant parts of the measured data to return reliable quantitative estimates of permittivity and conductivity. Here, we developed a full-waveform inversion scheme that uses a 3D frequency-domain solution of Maxwell's equations for a horizontally layered subsurface. Although a straightforward full-waveform inversion is relatively independent of the permittivity starting model, inaccuracies in the conductivity starting model result in erroneous effective wavelet amplitudes and therefore in erroneous inversion results, because the conductivity and wavelet amplitudes are coupled. Therefore, the permittivity and conductivity are updated together with the phase and the amplitude of the source wavelet with a gradient-free optimization approach. This novel full-waveform inversion is applied to synthetic and measured CMP data. In the case of synthetic single layered and waveguide data, where the starting model differs significantly from the true model parameter, we were able to reconstruct the obtained model properties and the effective source wavelet. For measured waveguide data, different starting values returned the same wavelet and quantitative permittivities and conductivities. This novel approach enables the quantitative estimation of permittivity and conductivity for the same sensing volume and enables an improved characterization for a wide range of applications.",10.1190/geo2012-0045.1
The Effect Of Sonde Position In The Hole On Responses Of Resistivity Logging Tools,"Theoretical relations exist in the literature for calculating the responses of electrode‐type resistivity logging tools when they are centered in the wellbore and the formations are thick and homogeneous (Fok, 1933; Stefanesco et al., 1929–32). These analyses are usually restricted to devices using dc or low‐frequency surveying currents, and they generally make use of the approximation of point electrodes. An analysis has also been made comparing the responses of such tools in anisotropic and isotropic formations (Kunz and Moran, 1958). In this paper, relations are derived for calculating the responses of electrode‐type logging tools when the sonde is not centered in the wellbore. Although similar relations could be applied to tilted sondes, the discussion in this paper is mainly restricted to the simple eccentered case in which the axis of the sonde is parallel to the axis of the hole. As will be shown, eccentering has a comparatively small effect on the responses of a normal device. On the other hand, certain types of focused‐log devices, in which a large proportion of the focusing current flows parallel to the hole, may exhibit an appreciable eccentering effect; this is particularly true when the contrast between formation resistivity and hole‐fluid resistivity is large. Spherically‐Focused‐Log (SFL*) resistivity devices (Schuster et al., 1971) have this type of current distribution, and, depending on electrode spacings, they may be appreciably influenced by eccentering. The applications shown in this paper will largely be done from SFL computations and measurements. The theoretical relations have been used in the development of a spherically focused tool less affected by eccentering. Tool responses predicted on the basis of the theoretical relations were found to be consistent with the results of test‐tank measurements made for one of the devices studied. Some field experiments have been made with centered and eccentered spherically focused tools, and more are to be done.",10.1190/1.1440734
Automatic Seismic Reflection Picking,"A computational system is described that detects seismic reflections recorded digitally on magnetic tape, performs migration if desired, and plots the information in cross‐section form. The detection or ""picking"" philosophy is based on the selection of the time positions of either all peaks or all troughs in the set of traces which constitutes the seismic section of interest. A lateral continuity search ""correlates"" these peaks or troughs across the traces in order to define reflection segments. All reflection segments which span at least three consecutive traces are stored in digital format on magnetic tape. They are given a grade which is the product of their spatial span and mean amplitude. A time‐varying grading threshold is employed to limit the number of reflection segments which are output to an automatic plotter or carried for subsequent processing such as computer migration. Several examples of these automatically derived cross sections are shown and compared with the original variable‐area record sections. This system is readily extended to multiline or grid data. Thus it is feasible to generate and display automatically three‐dimensional interpretive aids such as isochrons and isopachs.",10.1190/1.1439941
The Effects Of Cathodically Protected Pipelines On Aeromagnetic Surveys,"Many types of cultural noise are found in present‐day high‐resolution aeromagnetic data, and such noise must be removed if surveys flown in areas of existing cultural features are to be interpreted properly—particularly areas of oil and gas production. One of the worst causes of cultural noise in such areas is the dc electrical current passed through pipelines to prevent corrosion. This practice is called ""cathodic protection,"" and it is in common use worldwide; however, there is little or no discussion of the resulting magnetic anomalies in the geophysical literature. Cathodically protected pipeline (CPP) anomalies are particularly troublesome at the level of airborne surveys because they fall off slowly as the first power of the distance, rather than as the square or cube of the distance as in most sources of random cultural noise. However, the curve shapes of CPP anomalies are readily calculable: they depend upon the strike directions of the pipeline and the aeromagnetic profile, and on the inclination and declination of the Earth's magnetic field. The amplitude of CPP anomalies depends upon the height of the magnetometer above the pipeline and the strength of the current in the line. Standard curves were plotted for several CPP anomalies due to long, straight, horizontal pipelines, worldwide, and were used to verify the existence of CPP anomalies in production survey lines and tie lines for an aeromagnetic survey at the magnetic latitude of Oklahoma, USA.",10.1190/1.1442216
Homomorphic Deconvolution By Log Spectral Averaging,"A homomorphic system is used to map the convolution of a source function with the impulse response of the earth into the sum of the log spectra of the source function and the earth's response. If the source function is considered stationary and the earth's response spatially nonstationary, by averaging the log spectra of several reflection records, the log spectrum of the source function will be enhanced and the log spectrum of the earth's response will average out. An inverse homomorphic system maps the average log spectrum to an estimate of the source function. The source function is then deconvolved from reflection records. Application of log spectral averaging as a method of deconvolution to a seismic reflection profile obtained in a shallow water‐geologically complex area indicates the homomorphic technique to be an effective method for suppressing the air gun bubble pulse oscillation.",10.1190/1.1440780
Adaptive Multiple Subtraction Based On 3D Blind Separation Of Convolved Mixtures,"Multiple removal is one of the important preprocessing steps in a seismic data processing sequence. For an accurate multiple prediction, a full 3D method is required. However, the application of such methods is often limited by practical and economic constraints. Therefore, in practical situations, 2D prediction methods are used, such as 2D surface-related multiple elimination. However, the resulting predicted multiples may have significant temporal shift, spatial mismatch, and amplitude inconsistency, compared with true 3D multiples. Adaptive multiple subtraction based on 2D blind separation of convolved mixtures (BSCM) has been proposed to estimate the 2D matching filter in a single gather. To improve the flexibility of the adaptive multiple subtraction for the inconsistencies between the 2D predicted multiples and true 3D multiples, we evaluated the adaptive multiple subtraction as a problem of 3D BSCM. In the proposed method, the predicted multiples were modeled as the convolution of the true multiples with a 3D kernel, whose third dimension is in the gather direction. By maximizing the non-Gaussianity of the estimated primaries, the iterative reweighted least-squares algorithm was exploited to obtain the 3D matching filter, which is the inverse of the 3D kernel. To avoid the possible overfitting problem introduced by the 3D matching filter, the proposed method fit several seismic gathers using one 3D matching filter. In addition, by using the non-Gaussian maximization criterion, the proposed method alleviated the orthogonality assumption used by the least-squares subtraction method. Furthermore, the proposed method can eliminate the temporal and spatial mismatches between the 2D predicted multiples and true 3D multiples better than the 2D BSCM subtraction method. Tests on synthetic and field data sets demonstrated the effectiveness of the 3D BSCM subtraction method.",10.1190/geo2012-0455.1
Seismic Trace Interpolation In The F‐X‐Y Domain,"Seismic trace interpolation is implemented as a 2‐D (x, y) spatial prediction, performed separately on each frequency (f) slice. This so‐called f‐x‐y domain trace interpolation method is based on the relation that the linear prediction (LP) operator estimated at a given frequency may be used to predict data at a higher frequency but a smaller trace spacing. The relationship originally given for thef‐x domain trace interpolation is successfully extended to the f‐x‐y domain. The extension is achieved by masking the data samples selectively from the input frequency slice to design the LP operators. Two interpolation algorithms using the full‐step and the fractional‐step predictions, respectively, are developed. Both methods use an all‐azimuth prediction in the x‐y domain, but the fractional‐step prediction method is computationally more efficient. While the interpolation method can be applied to a common‐offset cube of 3‐D seismic, it can also be applied to 2‐D seismic traces for prestack data processing. Synthetic and real data examples demonstrate the capability of the interpolation method.",10.1190/1.1500385
A Simple Approach To Calculating Refraction Statics Corrections,"The higher the resolution demanded from the interpretation of seismic data, the more care required in the acquisition and processing of that data. Of the processing steps that directly influence resolution, the one that is having the most impact on land data is the statics correction. Geophysical conferences have devoted entire technical sessions to statics. Seismic crews frequently undertake specific refraction surveys just to obtain good statics data. Here we outline a very simple solution to the statics problem that produces remarkable results.",10.1190/1.1443527
Do Traveltimes In Pulse‐Transmission Experiments Yield Anisotropic Group Or Phase Velocities?,"The elastic properties of layered rocks are often measured using the pulse through‐transmission technique on sets of cylindrical cores cut at angles of 0, 90, and 45 degrees to the layering normal (e.g., Vernik and Nur, 1992; Lo et al., 1986; Jones and Wang, 1981). In this method transducers are attached to the flat ends of the three cores (see Figure 1), the first‐break traveltimes of P, SV, and SH‐waves down the axes are measured, and a set of transversely isotropic elastic constants are fit to the results. The usual assumption is that frequency dispersion, boundary reflections, and near‐field effects can all be safely ignored, and that the traveltimes measure either vertical anisotropic group velocity (if the transducers are very small compared to their separation) or phase velocity (if the transducers are relatively wide compared to their separation)  (Auld, 1973).",10.1190/1.1443564
A Unified Method For 2-D And 3-D Refraction Statics,"Most of the seismic data processing procedures are divided into 2-D, 2.5-D, crooked lines or 3-D versions dictated by the differences in the shot and receiver configurations. In this paper, we introduce a tomographic approach that overcomes these geometrical difficulties and provides stable statics solutions from picked first‐break times. We also show that the first‐break picks contain both the short and the long wavelength surface statics. The solutions are obtained by solving a set of generalized surface‐consistent delay‐time equations using the method of weighted least squares and conjugate gradient. While iterating, each first‐break pick is evaluated to ensure its consistency with the least‐squares solution. Based on consistency, we weight the traveltime picks and use them in the next iteration. These weights also serve as an indicator of anomalous picks to the user. We show that long wavelength solutions leave large residual errors in the least‐squares solutions. We also use the expected length of the Fresnel zone to differentiate between short and long wavelength static solutions. After removing the influence of long wavelength statics, we apply short wavelength statics to reduce the residual errors further. We demonstrate the validity of our unified method by applying it to actual data examples. The removal of both long and short wavelength statics improves the initial data set that produces a more consistent set of velocities and leaves only the short wavelength residual reflection statics, which are generally less than quarter wavelet period delays. This removes the most probable cause of the leg jump contamination and poor velocity estimates from the residual statics computations, especially from the 3-D data.",10.1190/1.1444320
On The Resource Evaluation Of Marine Gas Hydrate Deposits Using Sea‐Floor Transient Electric Dipole‐Dipole Methods,"Methane hydrates are solid, nonstoichiometric mixtures of water and the gas methane. They occur worldwide in sediment beneath the sea floor, and estimates of the total mass available there exceed 1016Kg. Since each volume of hydrate can yield up to 164 volumes of gas, offshore methane hydrate is recognized as a very important natural energy resource. The depth extent and stability of the hydrate zone is governed by the phase diagram for mixtures of methane and hydrate and determined by ambient pressures and temperatures. In sea depths greater than about 300 m, the pressure is high enough and the temperature low enough for hydrate to occur at the seafloor. The fraction of hydrate in the sediment usually increases with increasing depth. The base of the hydrate zone is a phase boundary between solid hydrate and free gas and water. Its depth is determined principally by the value of the geothermal gradient. It stands out on seismic sections as a bright reflection. The diffuse upper boundary is not as well marked so that the total mass of hydrate is not determined easily by seismic alone. The addition of electrical data, collected with a seafloor transient electric dipole‐dipole system, can aid in the evaluation of the resource. Methane hydrate, like ice, is electrically insulating. Deposits of hydrate in porous sediment cause an increase in the formation resistivity. The data consist of measurements of the time taken for an electrical disturbance to diffuse from the transmitting dipole to the receiving dipole. The traveltime is related simply to the resistivity: the higher the resistivity, the shorter the traveltime. A sounding curve may be obtained by measuring traveltimes as a function of the separation between the dipoles and interpreted in terms of the variation of porosity with depth. Two exploration scenarios are investigated through numerical modeling. In the first, a very simple example illustrating some of the fundamental characteristics of the electrical response, most of the properties of the section including the probable, regional thickness of the hydrate zone (200 m) are assumed known from seismic and spot drilling. The amount of hydrate in the available pore space is the only free parameter. Hydrate content expressed as a percentage may be determined to about ±ε given a measurement of traveltime at just one separation (800 m) to ε%. The rule holds over the complete range of anticipated hydrate content values. In the second example, less information is assumed available a priori and the complementary electrical survey is required to find both the thickness and the hydrate content in a hydrate zone about 200 m thick beneath the sea floor containing 20 and 40% hydrate in the available pore space, respectively. A linear eigenfunction analysis reveals that for these two models, the total mass of hydrate, the product of hydrate content and thickness, may be estimated to an accuracy of about 3ε% given measurements of traveltime to an accuracy of ε% over a range of separations from 100 to 1300 m. The value of the electrical information depends directly on the accuracy to which transient arrivals can be measured on the sea floor in water depths exceeding 300 m over a separation of the order of a kilometer, the error parameter ε. While results of appropriate surveys, or even noise measurements, have not been published in the open literature, surveys on a smaller 100 m scale have been conducted by my group. Based on these data, I suggest that the value of ε may be of the order of 3%.",10.1190/1.1444146
The Inverse Problem Of Resistivity Sounding,"The electric potential due to a single point electrode at the surface of a layered conducting medium is calculated by means of a linear combination of the potentials associated with a set of two‐layer systems. This new representation is called the bilayer expansion for the Green's function. It enables the forward problem of resistivity sounding to be solved very efficiently, even for complicated profiles. Also, the bilayer expansion facilitates the solution of the resistivity inverse problem: the coefficients in the expansion are linearly related to apparent resistivity as it is measured and they are readily mapped into parameters for a model. Specifically, I consider models comprising uniformly conducting layers of equal thickness; for a given finite data set a quadratic program can be used to find the best‐fitting model in this class for any specified thickness. As the thickness is reduced, models of this kind can approximate arbitrary profiles with unlimited accuracy. If there is a model that satisfies the data well, there are other models equally good or better whose variation takes place in an infinitesimally thin zone near the surface, below which there is a perfectly conducting region. This extraordinary class of solutions underscores the serious ambiguity in the interpretation of apparent resistivity data. It is evident that strong constraints from outside the electrical data set must be applied if reliable solutions are to be discovered. Previous work seems to have given a somewhat overly optimistic impression of the resolving abilities of this kind of data. I consider briefly a regularization technique designed to maximize the smoothness of models found with the bilayer inversion.",10.1190/1.1441630
Shallow 3-D Seismic Reflection Surveying: Data Acquisition And Preliminary Processing Strategies,"A comprehensive strategy of 3-D seismic reflection data acquisition and processing has been used in a study of glacial sediments deposited within a Swiss mountain valley. Seismic data generated by a downhole shotgun source were recorded with single 30-Hz geophones distributed at 3 m × 3 m intervals across a 357 m × 432 m area. For most common‐midpoint (CMP) bins, traces covering a full range of azimuths and source‐receiver distances of ∼2 to ∼125 m were recorded. A common processing scheme was applied to the entire data set and to various subsets designed to simulate data volumes collected with lower density source and receiver patterns. Comparisons of seismic sections extracted from the processed 3-D subsets demonstrated that high‐fold (40) and densely spaced (CMP bin sizes ⩽ 3 m × 3 m) data with relatively large numbers (6) of traces recorded at short (20 m) source‐receiver offsets were essential for obtaining clear images of the shallowest (100 ms) reflecting horizons. Reflections rich in frequencies 100 Hz at traveltimes of ∼20 to ∼170 ms provided a vertical resolution of 3 to 6 m over a depth range of ∼15 to ∼150 m. The shallowest prominent reflection at 20 to 35 ms (∼15 to 27 m depth) originated from the boundary between a near‐surface sequence of clays/silts and an underlying unit of heterogeneous sands/gravels.",10.1190/1.1444444
A Generalized Multibody Model For Inversion Of Magnetic Anomalies,"The height of the observation surface above a magnetized region primarily determines the critical dimension of the smallest inhomogeneity in magnetization that can be resolved from magnetic survey data. When a rectangular block is smaller in size than this critical dimension, it appears homogeneously magnetized in the observed magnetic field. This consideration leads to the selection of a unit rectangular block of suitable dimensions with homogeneous magnetization. The magnetized region creating the anomalous field values in the area of observation can, therefore, be broken up into several blocks having different magnetizations, each block being equal in size  and uniformly magnetized. The iterative method described here assumes initially that the anomalous field values are caused by a three‐dimensional (3-D) distribution of magnetized rectangular blocks. The optimum orientation of these blocks with respect to geographic north is then determined. This orientation is particularly insensitive to adjustments in the dimensions of the blocks. The top and bottom surfaces of each of the blocks in one or more layers are adjusted in a least‐squares sense to minimize the difference between observed and calculated field values. A method is also described for constraining the magnetization vector of each block to lie within a specified angle of the normal or reversed direction of the geomagnetic field vector. The procedure for analysis of data can also be extended to the case of anomalies over a draped surface. At the conclusion of the iterations, a 3-D distribution of magnetization is generated to delineate the magnetized region responsible for the observed anomalous magnetic field. Examples including model and aeromagnetic data are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of a generalized multibody model for inversion of magnetic anomalies.",10.1190/1.1441081
Using Csem Techniques To Map The Shallow Section Of Seafloor: From The Coastline To The Edges Of The Continental Slope,"Many important processes occur within the shallow section of the seafloor on the continental shelf and slope, yet conventional geophysical constraints on the physical properties within this critical boundary layer are limited. Some of the key constraints involve quantification of fluids within the seafloor, which can be provided by electrical methods. This paper reviews the application of a towed EM system to map the uppermost   20 m   of seafloor in a variety of settings ranging from nearshore regions in water depths of approximately   10 m   on the continental shelf out to water depths of   1300 m  . The system is a mapping tool that provides areal maps of seafloor resistivity and has been used for a variety of purposes, including sedimentary characterization and facies mapping, evaluation of groundwater discharge, and mapping seafloor mounds in the Gulf of Mexico, thought to contain massive deposits of gas hydrate.",10.1190/1.2434798
Hole‐To‐Surface Resistivity Measurements,"Hole‐to‐surface resistivity measurements over a layered volcanic tuff sequence illustrate procedures for gathering, reducing, and interpreting hole‐to‐surface resistivity data. The magnitude and direction of the total surface electric field resulting from a buried current source is calculated from orthogonal potential difference measurements for a grid of closely spaced stations. A contour map of these data provides a detailed map of the distribution of the electric field away from the drill hole. Resistivity anomalies can be enhanced by calculating the difference between apparent resistivities calculated from the total surface electric field and apparent resistivities for a layered earth model. Lateral discontinutities in the geoelectric section are verified by repeating the surface field measurments for current sources in several drill holes. A qualitative interpretation of the anomalous bodies within a layered earth can be made by using a three‐dimensional (3-D) resistivity model in a homogeneous half‐space. The general nature of resistive and conductive bodies causing anomalies away from the source drill holes is determined with the aid of data from several source holes, layered models, and 3-D models.",10.1190/1.1441410
Field Trials Of A Seismoelectric Method For Detecting Massive Sulfides,"An underground test of a seismoelectric prospecting method for massive sulfides was performed at the Mobrun Mine (Rouyn‐Noranda, Quebec) in June 1991. The method is based upon the conversion of seismic energy to high‐frequency pulses of electromagnetic radiation by sulfide minerals. The delay between shot detonation and detection of the electromagnetic radiation gives a one‐way traveltime for the acoustic wave to reach the zone of seismoelectric conversion, which when combined with P‐wave velocity allows the shot‐to‐ore zone distance to be calculated. A 0.22-kg explosive charge located within 50 m of the orebody provided the seismic excitation, and the resulting electromagnetic emissions were received by electric dipole and induction‐coil antennas. First‐arrival information from a 35‐shot survey above an orebody, the 1100 lens, provides firm evidence that short duration pulses of electromagnetic radiation are produced by the passage of acoustic waves through the orebody. The survey also demonstrated that seismoelectric conversions could be induced at shot‐to‐orebody distances of 50 m and detected at distances of up to 150 m from the orebody. Areas of seismoelectric conversion are highlighted in sections produced by plotting the position of seismic wavefronts during signal reception. The sections show anomalies that correlate with the known structure and location of the orebody and demonstrate the potential of using this seismoelectric phenomenon as an exploration tool.",10.1190/1.1443772
Focal Mechanism Determination Of Induced Microearthquakes In An Oil Field Using Full Waveforms From Shallow And Deep Seismic Networks,"A new, relatively high frequency, full waveform matching method was used to study the focal mechanisms of small, local earthquakes induced in an oil field, which are monitored by a sparse near-surface network and a deep borehole network. The determined source properties are helpful for understanding the local stress regime in this field. During the waveform inversion, we maximize both the phase and amplitude matching between the observed and modeled waveforms. We also use the polarities of the first P-wave arrivals and the average S/P amplitude ratios to better constrain the matching. An objective function is constructed to include all four criteria. For different hypocenters and source types, comprehensive synthetic tests showed that our method is robust enough to determine the focal mechanisms under the current array geometries, even when there is considerable velocity inaccuracy. The application to several tens of induced microseismic events showed satisfactory waveform matching between modeled and observed seismograms. Most of the events have a strike direction parallel with the major northeast-southwest faults in the region, and some events trend parallel with the northwest-southeast conjugate faults. The results are consistent with the in situ well breakout measurements and the current knowledge on the stress direction of this region. The source mechanisms of the studied events, together with the hypocenter distribution, indicate that the microearthquakes are caused by the reactivation of preexisting faults. We observed that the faulting mechanism varies with depth, from strike-slip dominance at shallower depth to normal faulting dominance at greater depth.",10.1190/geo2011-0030.1
Effective Reflection Coefficients For Curved Interfaces In Transversely Isotropic Media,"Plane-wave reflection coefficients (PWRCs) are routinely used in amplitude-variation-with-offset analysis and for generating boundary data in Kirchhoff modeling. However, the geometrical-seismics approximation based on PWRCs becomes inadequate in describing reflected wavefields at near- and postcritical incidence angles. Also, PWRCs are derived for plane interfaces and break down in the presence of significant reflector curvature. Here, we discuss effective reflection coefficients (ERCs) designed to overcome the limitations of PWRCs for multicomponent data from heterogeneous anisotropic media. We represent the reflected wavefield in the immediate vicinity of a curved interface by a generalized plane-wave decomposition, which approximately reduces to the conventional Weyl-type integral computed for an apparent source location. The ERC then is obtainedas the ratio of the reflected and incident wavefields at each point of the interface. To conduct diffraction modeling, we combine ERCs with the tip-wave superposition method (TWSM), extended to elastic media. This methodology is implemented for curved interfaces that separate an isotropic incidence half-space and a transversely isotropic (TI) medium with the symmetry axis orthogonal to the reflector. If the interface is plane, ERCs generally are close to the exact solution, sensitive to the anisotropy parameters and source-receiver geometry. Numerical tests demonstrate that the difference between ERCs and PWRCs for typical TI models can be significant, especially at low frequencies and in the postcritical domain. For curved interfaces, ERCs provide a practical approximate tool to compute the reflected wavefield. We analyze the dependence of ERCs on reflector shape and demonstrate their advantages over PWRCs in 3D diffraction modeling of PP and PS reflection data.",10.1190/1.3197862
Electrical-Prospecting Method For Hydrocarbon Search Using The Induced-Polarization Effect,"We propose a method of surface and marine electrical prospecting using controlled-source excitation. The method is designed to detect hydrocarbon deposits at depths of a few kilometers and to map their boundaries. The technique is based on imaging the induced-polarization (IP) parameters of the geologic formation. We use the fact that, because of the imaginary part of the electric conductivity, polarized media support wave propagation processes whose nature is similar to displacement currents induced by the dielectric permittivity. However, unlike displacement currents, these processes reveal themselves at much lower frequencies and, therefore, at greater depths. It is established that the ratio of the second and the first differences of the electric potential does not decay after the current turn-off in polarized media, whereas it decays quickly if the IP effect is absent. Thus, the IP response can be observed directly and separated from the electromagnetic (EM) response. We use a vertical focusing of the electric current to decrease the effect of laterally adjacent formations to apply a 1D layered model in a 3D environment. This method obtained promising results in several regions of Russia.",10.1190/1.2217367
3D Ultra Shallow Seismic Imaging Of Buried Pipe Using Dense Receiver Array: Practical And Theoretical Considerations,"Direct 3D imaging of a  6″  pipe, buried at a depth of   1.5 m  , using portable dense receiver array shows that small objects associated with large impedance contrast can be precisely imaged. Detailed velocity analysis applied to backscattered wavefield from small buried objects provides resolution of less than   10 m∕s  . Comparison of backscattered wavefield observations to analytical solutions show a generally good match. Theoretical calculations also show that the object can be detected with wavelengths much larger than its size due to the large contrast associated with its hollow shape. Dense spatial sampling is needed to capture the energy emitted from the scattering object and successfully focus it by diffraction imaging. Portable dense receiver array can provide a cost-effective solution for such tasks.",10.1190/1.3506560
Using Combinations Of Spatial Gradients To Improve The Detectability Of Buried Conductors Below Or Within Conductive Material,"The detection of conductive bodies is an important capability when exploring for massive sulfide deposits or looking for unexploded ordnance. When these bodies are buried below conductive overburden or embedded in conductive material, the use of an electromagnetic system to identify the bodies becomes problematic because the response of the overlying conductive material can be much greater that the response of the buried conductor. I calculated the response of five models representing different conductivity distributions (a buried conductor, a uniform overburden with changes in the system altitude, a paleochannel, a thicker overburden, and a thinner overburden). The subtle response of the buried conductor was difficult to identify because it looked very similar to the responses of other structures that are not necessarily of interest. The spatial gradients for the same five models showed that the greatest improvement in the relative size of the anomalous gradient response compared with the background gradient came for the cases in which the material closest to the surface changes, in particular the paleochannel and thickening overburden models. However, identification of the deeper buried conductor was still problematic because of the large background gradients. In theory, the cylindrical symmetry of a dipole transmitter over a layered earth ensured that there were exact relations between the spatial derivatives. Hence it was possible to define two specific combinations that should be zero over a layered earth. Calculating these combinations for the five models showed that the anomalous zones stood out with significantly greater anomaly-to-background ratios. The measurement of the gradients and the calculation of these combinations therefore provided a means of identifying anomalous zones in and below a conductive earth. Different relative sizes and shapes of the two combinations for different models provided a way of discriminating between the vertical conductor model and the four other models.",10.1190/geo2012-0210.1
On The Approximation Of Finite Loop Sources By Two‐Dimensional Line Sources,"An appealing feature of time‐domain electromagnetics is that the transient response simplifies considerably at late time, usually tending to a power‐law or exponential decay. In this note, we point out an interesting discrepancy between the late‐time asymptotics of a finite loop source over a half‐space and its natural two‐dimensional (2-D) approximation, which is two line sources of opposite polarity lying on a half‐space. Expressions for the transient responses of both loop (Wait and Ott, 1972) and line sources (Oristaglio, 1982) have been derived before; they show that at late times the voltage induced in a horizontal receiving coil decays as t-2.5 for a loop source and t-2 for a line source. Here we show that the slower decay for the line source is inherently a 2-D effect. To do this, we derive a closed‐form expression for the transient voltage induced by a finite wire of length 2L on a half‐space—a new result, for which we can separately examine the limits L←∞ and t→∞. Surprisingly, these limits are not interchangeable. First taking L to be infinite and then doing the late‐time asymptotic expansion yields the t-2 decay of a line source; in contrast, first doing the late‐time expansion gives a decay of t-2.5 for the finite wire, which is formally unchanged as the length goes to infinity.",10.1190/1.1441717
Accounting For Spatially Variable Resolution In Electrical Resistivity Tomography Through Field-Scale Rock-Physics Relations,"A number of issues impact electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) inversions: how ERT measurements sample the subsurface, the nature of subsurface heterogeneity, the geometry selected for data collection, the choice of data-misfit criteria, and regularization of the inverse problem. Lab-scale rock-physics models, typically used to estimate solute concentration from ERT, do not accommodate or account for these issues and therefore produce inaccurate geophysical estimates of solute concentrations. In contrast, the influence of measurement sensitivity and inversion artifacts can be captured by pixel-based rock-physics relationships, determined using numerical analogs that recreate the field-scale ERT experiment based on flow and transport modeling and a priori data. In the 2D synthetic example presented here, where ERT is used to monitor the transport of a saline tracer through the subsurface, improved estimates of concentration are obtained when field-scale rock-physics relationships based on numerical analogs are used.",10.1190/1.2209753
Refraction And Reflection Of Seismic Waves I. Fundamentals,"We give in this paper an exposition of the fundamental theory underlying the theory of reflection and refraction seismic waves. It was thought useful to include material not strictly new along with the new material, because the sources are not easily obtained by many readers of this magazine. Knott's energy equation is given a simple interpretation. Conditions at the interface are discussed together with the limitations of these conditions, as conditions by which our problem is to be solved. It appears that the energy flow must be considered as well as the interface conditions.",10.1190/1.1440492
A New Instrument For Seismic Exploration At Very Short Ranges,"An instrument is described for use in seismic investigation of subsurface structure to a maximum depth of about 100 feet. A hammer is used as source of seismic energy. A cathode‐ray tube replaces the usual galvanometers as display device, and seismic arrivals are timed electronically by a modified radar technique. Only one seismometer is used, and travel times for different ranges are obtained by moving the hammer along the traverse line. Applications will lie mainly in the field of civil engineering. Field tests made at a dam site are compared with direct borehole tests of the subsurface structure.",10.1190/1.1437757
The Use Of Poisson'S Relation For The Extraction Of Pseudototal Magnetic Field Intensity From Gravity Observations,"Investigation of geological structure by gravimetric and magnetic field surveys requires consideration of relationships between gravity anomaly and magnetic anomaly generating sources. The possibility of using Poisson's Relation to examine magnetic and gravity fields related to a common source is intriguing. This relation is expressed as follows: A(x,y,z)=IGρ∂U(x,y,z)∂α, (1) where A (x, y, z) is the magnetic field potential and U (x, y, z) is the gravity field potential at a point in space due to a source of uniform density ρ and uniform magnetization I in the direction α. This expression has been used to derive magnetic anomalies over idealized forms (Nettleton, 1940) and, by Baranov (1957), to extract pseudogravity fields from magnetic field data. The purpose of this paper is to develop an expression for extracting a pseudomagnetic field from gravity field data and to examine the practical applications of this expression.",10.1190/1.1440195
Azimuthal Variation In P-Wave Signatures Due To Fluid Flow,"The favored dominant mechanism for attenuation in the upper crust at seismic frequencies is intracrack fluid flow. In cracked media, the azimuthal attenuation of the P-wave amplitudes arising from such flow is predicted to be quite substantial. The consequence of this variation in azimuth is a modification in the amplitude behavior of the base event from a cracked reservoir due to transmission through the attenuative layer. Indeed, the effect is of sufficient strength to exacerbate, diminish, or reverse variations that arise solely due to the reflectivity coefficient. Thus, although this attenuation is always greatest perpendicular to the crack strike, the direction of the dimming or brightening of the base reservoir event will depend upon the exact attenuation law and the crack properties. The combination of these factors contributes to a wave behavior that can provide a more adequate discrimination between conditions of brine and oil fill than an interpretation assuming the reflection coefficient alone. Unfortunately, regions of commonality do remain, and the distinction between fills is still only apparent for particular reservoir and crack conditions. The attenuated amplitudes are large enough to be seen at small offsets and may possibly account for the significant azimuthal variations in the P-wave signatures observed in field data.",10.1190/1.1444625
Surface‐Consistent Deconvolution,"Using first principles, I formulate surface‐consistent deconvolution as a problem in optimization, to which I apply methods for nonlinear least‐squares. To minimize processing artifacts, I avoid data transformations such as Fourier transforms or slant stacks. My deconvolution filters are computed as approximate solutions to a large, sparse, least‐squares system. Useful solutions are obtained in a few iterations, with each iteration equivalent in cost to performing a single‐trace deconvolution of the data. The use of optimization removes a great deal of uncertainty about the results of surface‐consistent deconvolution. If, with a given choice of filter length, etc., a good deconvolution can be obtained, it is obtained. I illustrate the method and its limitations with three instructive field examples. The first underlines the issues of uncertainty and reliability. The other two show how surface‐consistent deconvolution can degrade as seismic data depart from the surface‐consistent model by small and large amounts, respectively.",10.1190/1.1442747
Rock-Physics Modeling Guided By Depositional And Burial History In Low-To-Intermediate-Porosity Sandstones,"We present a new rock-physics modeling approach to describe the elastic properties of low-to-intermediate-porosity sandstones that incorporates the depositional and burial history of the rock. The studied rocks have been exposed to complex burial and diagenetic history and show great variability in rock texture and reservoir properties. Our approach combines granular medium contact theory with inclusion-based models to build rock-physics templates that take into account the complex burial history of the rock. These models are used to describe well log data from tight gas sandstone reservoirs in Saudi Arabia, and successfully explain the pore fluid, rock porosity, and pore shape trends in these complex reservoirs.",10.1190/geo2013-0226.1
Time-Reverse Imaging With Limited S-Wave Velocity Model Information,"Time-reverse imaging is a wave propagation algorithm for locating sources. Signals recorded by synchronized receivers are reversed in time and propagated back to the source location by elastic wavefield extrapolation. Elastic wavefield extrapolation requires a P-wave as well as an S-wave velocity model. The velocity models available from standard reflection seismic methods are usually restricted to only P-waves. In this study, we use synthetically produced time signals to investigate the accuracy of seismic source localization by means of time-reverse imaging with the correct P-wave and a perturbed S-wave velocity model. The studies reveal that perturbed S-wave velocity models strongly influence the intensity and position of the focus. Imaging the results with the individual maximum energy density for both body wave types instead of mixed modes allows individual analysis of the two body waves. P-wave energy density images render stable focuses in case of a correct P-wave and incorrect S-wave velocity model. Thus, P-wave energy density seems to be a more suitable imaging condition in case of a high degree of uncertainty in the S-wave velocity model.",10.1190/geo2010-0303.1
Interpretation Of Three‐Component Borehole Magnetometer Data,"We have made a theoretical study of the problem of locating and defining a magnetized prism in the vicinity of a drillhole. The study shows that a three‐component borehole magnetometer can be very useful in exploration for deep magnetic targets, which are difficult to intersect by drilling. There are nine parameters to be estimated from the data: the x, y, and z positions of the center of the prism; length, width and depth extent; and the three parameters defining the magnetization vector. The parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the predicted and observed data. Since the problem is nonlinear, it must be solved iteratively. At each iteration a singular value analysis of the sensitivity matrix is performed, and a particular solution is chosen from a set of minimal length solutions; each solution corresponds to a different rank of the sensitivity matrix. The main difficulty is an ambiguity involving the position parameters and the parameters defining the magnetization vector. In order to minimize this obstacle, a parameter scaling matrix is introduced. The effects of noise, wrong model, probe orientation errors, borehole length, and data density are analyzed. We have found that the position and depth extent of the body can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.",10.1190/1.1441179
Quantitative Uranium Determinations From Gamma‐Ray Logs By Application Of Digital Time Series Analysis,"The desired output from a gamma‐ray logging system in mining applications is an accurate log of the quantitative distribution of radioelements with depth along the borehole. However, the measured log is not the desired output, but it may be visualized as the desired output modified by a series of low‐pass filters of various characteristics. These filters can be related to the distance interval over which each count is made (or the analog ratemeter time constant), the detector length, and the ""geologic impulse response"" (the response of a point detector to an infinitesimally thin layer of ore of a known grade). In effect, this means that the response due to thin beds is lower than expected, and the resolution will be reduced. An understanding of the nature and properties of these filters will aid in the proper evaluation of the log. To optimize the accuracy and resolution of quantitative uranium (or other radioelement) determinations, especially in thin beds and complex sequences, it is necessary to keep the counting interval short, and to compensate for the effect of the geologic impulse response. Although the effect of the geologic impulse response may be removed in any of several ways, the use of a simple inverse convolution operator as described here allows the data to be processed on‐line, essentially in real time, using a microprocessor or portable minicomputer.",10.1190/1.1440888
Using 3D Finite-Difference Modeling To Design Wide-Azimuth Surveys For Improved Subsalt Imaging,"Three-dimensional finite-difference modeling studies conducted over subsalt structures in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico confirm the deficiencies of narrow-azimuth towed-streamer surveys and predict significant improvement in image quality with wide-azimuth methods. Finite-difference modeling has provided important design parameters for two separate approaches for wide-azimuth surveys: ocean-bottom receivers distributed in a sparse grid on the ocean floor coupled with a dense grid of source points on the surface, and a wide-azimuth towed-streamer method using multiple seismic vessels in a novel configuration. These two methods complement each other. Ocean-bottom receivers may be used effectively where field development has resulted in many obstacles that might interfere with towed-streamer methods, where the required size of the 3D survey is not too extensive, or where very long offsets are required for all azimuths. Towed-streamer methods are more efficient for large surveys, and key parameters in the wide-azimuth towed-streamer method can be varied to provide a wide range of cost versus data-quality options to make the method suitable for application in scenarios ranging from exploration to field development.",10.1190/1.2668602
"Geophysical History Of The Delhi Field, Richland, Franklin, And Madison Parishes, Louisiana","The geophysical history of the Delhi Field started in 1938 when a Gulf gravity crew entered the area. In early 1940 results of drilling to the east indicated the absence of Tuscaloosa beds and a possible pinchout. In 1944, a seismograph crew under contract to Sun Oil Company and C. H. Murphy entered the area. A small closure was found and drilled. Production was established in 1944 from Paluxy beds.",10.1190/1.1437656
"Correction To Letter ""On Electromagnetic Induction In Elongated Ore Bodies,"" Geophysics, V. 38, No. 5, P. 984–985","If galley proofs of this letter had been sent to author, I would have indicated that the effect of the truncation of the infinite cylinder would be to ""de‐emphasize"" rather than to ""wipe out"" the monopole or m=0 term. Quantitative results to illustrate this effect for a finite cylinder are included in an article accepted for Geofisica Internacional (Mexico). Also it should be noted that the erratum to the 1952 reference was incorrectly printed in the cited letter.",10.1190/1.1440425
Tuning Effect And Interference Reflections From Thin Beds And Coal Seams,"The Ricker and Widess criteria of resolving thin beds are established and widely accepted axioms. Analysis of tuning effects from an isolated thinning bed is commonly used in estimating the thickness of a thin bed. However, frequency and amplitude tuning effects may also result from a sequence of thin beds. Depending on the thicknesses, acoustic properties, and the relative location of thin beds in space, tuning effects from interference reflections can sometimes deform the seismic wavelet and cause complex waveforms. Coal seams as thin as 1/20 of the predominant wavelength can produce reflections, and these reflections may be a composite of primary and multiple reflections. Interference reflections from two closely spaced coal seams were recorded and used to interpret a seam anomaly (roll) that may create adverse conditions for longwall mining. The seismic data and computer model results correlated with findings of several boreholes.",10.1190/1.1443151
Stacking Apertures And Estimation Strategies For Reflection And Diffraction Enhancement,"It is well known that the quality of stacking results (e.g., noise reduction, event enhancement, and continuity) can be greatly influenced not only by the traveltime operator chosen but also by the apertures used. We have considered two so-called diffraction-stack traveltimes, together with the corresponding apertures, designed to enhance reflections and diffractions, respectively. The first one is the common-reflection-surface (CRS) diffraction traveltime that is obtained from the general CRS traveltime upon the condition that the target reflector reduced to a point, which we refer to as the diffraction CRS (DCRS) traveltime. The second one is the double-square-root (DSR) traveltime, well established in time migration. We have observed that the DCRS and DSR traveltimes depend on fewer parameters (two in 2D and five in 3D) than the full CRS traveltime (three in 2D and eight in 3D). For the DCRS and DSR traveltimes, we have proposed specific apertures based on the projected Fresnel zone, which are able to produce high-quality stacked sections using less parameters to be estimated. The key factor in that approach lies in the choice of traveltime operators together with careful selection of stacking apertures. In particular, suitable choices of operators and apertures lead to stacking volumes in which reflections are enhanced (and the diffractions are attenuated) or the corresponding ones in which diffractions are enhanced (and reflections are attenuated). Synthetic and field data confirm the proposed approach has good potential for image-quality improvement.",10.1190/geo2015-0525.1
"Physical Modeling Of The Full Acoustic Waveform In A Fractured, Fluid‐Filled Borehole","Three concrete models were constructed, one each with a fracture oriented at 90, 45, and 10 degrees to the axis of the borehole. These were used to simulate physically the propagation of the full acoustic waveform through a fluid‐filled borehole in crystalline rock and to ascertain the effects of fracture aperture and orientation of fluid‐filled fractures on the waveform. The tube‐wave mode of the waveform was most indicative of the magnitude of fracture aperture. Normalized tube‐wave amplitude decreased as a negative exponential function of aperture over the range of fracture apertures studied (closed to 0.66 cm). The 90 degree fracture orientation caused greater tube‐wave amplitude reduction than the 45 degree fracture. We hypothesize that this reduction can be attributed to the borehole wall's guiding the wave across the 45 degree fracture. However, the 10 degree model gave ambiguous results, which are believed to be related to the low ratio of tube‐wave wavelength to aperture as measured parallel to the borehole axis, i.e., axial aperture.",10.1190/1.1442562
"Downhole Seismic Imaging Of A Massive Sulfide Orebody With Mode‐Converted Waves, Halfmile Lake, New Brunswick, Canada","Multioffset, multiazimuth downhole seismic data were acquired at Halfmile lake, New Brunswick, to image known massive sulfide lenses and to investigate the potential existence of a steeply dipping mineralized zone connecting them. The massive sulfide lenses, which have significantly higher elastic impedances than host rocks, produce strong scattering. The downhole seismic data show prominent scattered (P‐P and S‐S) and mode‐converted (P‐S and S‐P) waves originating from the deposit. Such complex scattering from massive sulfide ore was not observed previously in vertical seismic profiling data. Migration of the scattered and mode‐converted waves from several shot points imaged different parts of the deepest lens. The scattered S‐waves and mode‐converted waves provide additional imaging capabilities that should be considered when selecting downhole seismic methods for mining exploration.",10.1190/1.1707051
Estimation Of Near‐Surface Shear‐Wave Velocity By Inversion Of Rayleigh Waves,"The shear‐wave (S-wave) velocity of near‐surface materials (soil, rocks, pavement) and its effect on seismic‐wave propagation are of fundamental interest in many groundwater, engineering, and environmental studies. Rayleigh‐wave phase velocity of a layered‐earth model is a function of frequency and four groups of earth properties: P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, density, and thickness of layers. Analysis of the Jacobian matrix provides a measure of dispersion‐curve sensitivity to earth properties. S-wave velocities are the dominant influence on a dispersion curve in a high‐frequency range (5 Hz) followed by layer thickness. An iterative solution technique to the weighted equation proved very effective in the high‐frequency range when using the Levenberg‐Marquardt and singular‐value decomposition techniques. Convergence of the weighted solution is guaranteed through selection of the damping factor using the Levenberg‐Marquardt method. Synthetic examples demonstrated calculation efficiency and stability of inverse procedures. We verify our method using borehole S-wave velocity measurements.",10.1190/1.1444578
Three‐Dimensional Gravity Or Magnetic Constrained Depth Inversion With Lateral And Vertical Variation Of Contrast,"Depth‐mapping inversion of gravity or magnetic fields generally assumes that anomalies originate from a main density or magnetization contrast interface. This particular inversion takes into account inhomogeneous density or magnetization distributions reflecting sediment compaction and basement heterogeneities: above the interface, the density can be approximated by an exponential function, and below it, an intrabasement contrast map can be used. The inversion also integrates local depth constraints from wells or seismic data, as well as general constraints set on the geometry and the contrast of the interface. After field transformations, spectral analysis and constraints help to define a starting model characterized mainly by the interface mean depth and the mean parameter contrast between the two media. The depth adjustment is completed iteratively under constraints using a space‐domain formulation derived from the Bouguer‐slab approximation. The interface model effect is computed in the wavenumber domain. A model data example shows the accuracy of the inversion and illustrates the role of the constraints. In a field example of a basin area where constraints can be derived from numerous well data, successive inversions of gravity data result in an isodepth map of the basement. The compatibility of the map with local depth constraints from wells is obtained by taking into account density heterogeneities related to known lithologic variations in the basement.",10.1190/1.1442840
Vertical Resolution Of A Seismic Survey In Stratigraphic Sequences Less Than 100 M Deep In Southeastern Kansas,"A 400-m long, 12‐fold high‐resolution common depth point (CDP) reflection seismic profile was acquired across shallow converging Pennsylvanian strata in the Independence area of southeastern Kansas. One of the principal objectives was to determine practical vertical resolution limits in an excellent shallow seismic‐data area with borehole control. The dominant frequency of the CDP stacked data is in excess of 150 Hz based on peak‐to‐peak measurements. Interference phenomena observed on stacked seismic data incorporated with models derived from log and drill‐hole information suggest a practical vertical resolution limit of about 7 m, or one‐third of the dominant wavelength. This practical resolution is slightly less than the predicted (theoretical) resolution limit of 5 m based on the generally accepted one‐quarter wavelength axiom. These data suggest conventional rules of thumb describing resolution potential are not accurate when reflectors on shallow, narrow bandwidth data converge rapidly across horizontal distances less than the Fresnel Zone.",10.1190/1.1443779
Proposed Standards For Seismic Amplifiers... And What They Mean To Field Records,"Seismic amplifier performance may be categorized broadly into AGC action, filtering, and distortion (including noise). Eight specifications can define the characteristics of each as follows: AGC— 1. Steady‐state AGC including ""burst‐out"", 2. AGC control vs frequency, 3. Dynamic AGC action, 4. AGC distortion effects; Filtering— 5. Amplitude response, 6. Phase response; Noise and 7. Pre‐filter distortion; Distortion—8. Internal amplifier noise. These eight specifications allow a user to predict, and consequently allow for, amplifier action—both desirable and deleterious—in obtaining field records. The author proposes that these specifications, coupled with the usual ""external"" specifications, be considered as a starting point for establishing a standardized method of specifying seismic amplifier characteristics similar to the SEG ""Standard Methods of Specifying Performance"" for magnetic recording.",10.1190/1.1438911

Seismic Spectral Decomposition Using Deconvolutive Short-Time Fourier Transform Spectrogram,"The spectral decomposition technique plays an important role in reservoir characterization, for which the time-frequency distribution method is essential. The deconvolutive short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) method achieves a superior time-frequency resolution by applying a 2D deconvolution operation on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrogram. For seismic spectral decomposition, to reduce the computation burden caused by the 2D deconvolution operation in the DSTFT, the 2D STFT spectrogram is cropped into a smaller area, which includes the positive frequencies fallen in the seismic signal bandwidth only. In general, because the low-frequency components of a seismic signal are dominant, the removal of the negative frequencies may introduce a sharp edge at the zero frequency, which would produce artifacts in the DSTFT spectrogram. To avoid this problem, we used the analytic signal, which is obtained by applying the Hilbert transform on the original real seismic signal, to calculate the STFT spectrogram in our method. Synthetic and real seismic data examples were evaluated to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.",10.1190/geo2012-0125.1
"Surface Ship Gravity Measurements On The Texas A. And M. College Ship, The ""Hidalgo""","Gravity meter readings taken at sea are disturbed by the motion of the ship and thus involve accelerations thousands of times greater than the permissible error.

A meter which allows this to be done is described, and data obtained on a surface ship are presented with such checks as were available.",10.1190/1.1438587
Interface Conditions For Acoustic And Elastic Wave Propagation,"The divergence theorem is used to handle the physics required at interfaces for acoustic and elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous media. The physics required at regular and irregular interfaces is incorporated into numerical schemes by integrating across the interface. The technique, which can be used with many numerical schemes, is applied to finite differences. A derivation of the acoustic wave equation, which is readily handled by this integration scheme, is outlined. Since this form of the equation is equivalent to the scalar SH wave equation, the scheme can be applied to this equation also. Each component of the elastic P‐SV equation is presented in divergence form to apply this integration scheme, naturally incorporating the continuity of the normal and tangential stresses required at regular and irregular interfaces.",10.1190/1.1443029
Texture-Based Classification Of Ground-Penetrating Radar Images,"Image texture is one of the key features used for the interpretation of radar facies in ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data. Establishing quantitative measures of texture is therefore a critical step in the effective development of advanced techniques for the interpretation of GPR images. This study presents the first effort to evaluate whether different measures of a GPR image capture the features of the data that, when coupled with a neural network classifier, are able to reproduce a human interpretation. The measures compared in this study are instantaneous amplitude and frequency, as well as the variance, covariance, Fourier-Mellin transform, R-transform, and principle components (PCs) determined for a window of radar data. A   50-MHz   GPR section collected over the William River delta in Saskatchewan, Canada, is used for the analysis. We found that measures describing the local spatial structure of the GPR image (i.e., covariance, Fourier-Mellin, R-transform, and PCs) were able to reproduce human interpretations with greater than 93% accuracy. In contrast, classifications based on image variance and the instantaneous attributes agreed with the human interpretation less than 68% of the time. Among the textural measures that preserve spatial structure, we found that the best ones are insensitive to within facies variability while emphasizing differences between facies. For the specific case of the William River delta, the Fourier-Mellin transform, which retains information about the spatial correlation of reflections while remaining insensitive to their orientation, outperformed the other measures. Our work in describing radar texture provides an important first step in defining quantitative criteria that can be used to aid in the classification of radar data.",10.1190/1.2356114
Effects Of Fluid Viscosity On Shear‐Wave Attenuation In Partially Saturated Sandstone,"Shear‐wave attenuation and velocity have been measured in the kiloHertz frequency range at temperatures varying from −80°C to 80°C in a sample of Berea sandstone partially saturated with glycerol. I investigated 7 saturation states ranging from 0 to 62 percent of the pore space. Plots of attenuation versus temperature show squirt and viscous shear peaks, even at low saturation. Their amplitudes and half‐widths increase with increasing saturation. The maxima of the peaks progressively move to higher temperatures (about 4°C for viscous shear peak and 30°C for squirt peak) with increasing saturation from 7 to 62 percent. The velocity dispersion between −80°C and 80°C progressively increases from 700 to 1200 m/s with increasing saturation from 7 to 62 percent. By introducing the crack saturation parameter, a simple viscoelastic model based on O'Connell and Budiansky and using a Cole‐Cole distribution of cracks, is proposed for calculating the shear modulus in partially saturated rocks. This model partially interprets the experimental data.",10.1190/1.1443145
Effects Of Pipelines On Spectral Induced‐Polarization Surveys,The formal electromagnetic coupling solution for a dipole-dipole electrode array configuration has been modified to include cultural coupling in a uniform conducting half‐space. Solutions are obtained for survey lines oriented at an arbitrary position and angle with respect to a cylindrical structure. The convergence properties of the general mutual impedance solution are analyzed using a low‐frequency approximation which is useful in predicting cultural anomalies in the frequency range of spectral IP surveys as long as all significant dimensions are less than one skin depth. Both interfacial polarization and induced currents in the cylindrical conductor are considered in examining the behavior of the overall spectrum as seen by an external observer. Spectral responses for dipole-dipole arrays oriented perpendicular and parallel to the buried conductor show that the phase shift is the most diagnostic parameter for pipe depth and survey data distortion. The results also show that field survey procedures can be devised to minimize such interference effects when the pipe position is known.,10.1190/1.1441609
3D Stochastic Gravity Inversion Using Nonstationary Covariances,"The flexibility of geostatistical inversions in geophysics is limited by the use of stationary covariances, which, implicitly and mostly for mathematical convenience, assumes statistical homogeneity of the studied field. For fields showing sharp contrasts due, for example, to faults or folds, an approach based on the use of nonstationary covariances for cokriging inversion was developed. The approach was tested on two synthetic cases and one real data set. Inversion results based on the nonstationary covariance were compared to the results from the stationary covariance for two synthetic models. The nonstationary covariance better recovered the known synthetic models. With the real data set, the nonstationary assumption resulted in a better match with the known surface geology.",10.1190/geo2012-0122.1
Some Unorthodox Petroleum Exploration Methods,"Over a period of three years, more than a hundred new or little‐known methods of seeking underground petroleum deposits were impartially evaluated. Most of these methods were the products of independent inventors. A large proportion of the methods proved to have little or no scientific foundation; nevertheless, the protagonists were afforded ample opportunity to prove the value of the methods by field performance. The results with every such method on which adequate data were accumulated were either negative or inconclusive. The methods which possessed some degree of technical merit included a few worthy of careful scientific study. These belonged to the general fields of seismic improvements, geochemical and radioactivity techniques, and electrical techniques. Some of these methods have received a degree of attention from laboratories of major oil‐producing companies. Several examples of unorthodox methods are described. Scientifically trained persons can often detect fallacious methods by the protagonists' gross misuse of technical language. However, a study of the principles involved and statistically valid field testing are more conclusive.",10.1190/1.1438552
"Gravity‐Meter Survey Of The Kettleman Hills‐Lost Hills Trend, California","The gravity anomalies produced by the three Kettleman Hills Domes are maxima. The Lost Hills Anticline produces a gravity minimum. Four maps showing gravity contours, subsurface contours and sections accompany this paper. Maps from a gravity survey over the Kettleman Hills‐Lost Hills Area are compared with previously published subsurface contours and cross sections. These show that the three Kettleman Hills Domes each produce a strong and definite gravity high while the Lost Hills Anticline produces a very clear and closely corresponding gravity low. The paper points out the probable cause of this unusual feature as being a transition within the Reef Ridge Formation from punky, diatomaceous shale at Lost Hills to clays and sands at Kettleman Hills.",10.1190/1.1437226
3-D Prestack Migration Of Common‐Azimuth Data,"In principle, downward continuation of 3-D prestack data should be carried out in the 5-D space of full 3-D prestack geometry (recording time, source surface location, and receiver surface location), even when the data sets to be migrated have fewer dimensions, as in the case of common‐azimuth data sets that are only four dimensional. This increase in dimensionality of the computational space causes a severe increase in the amount of computations required for migrating the data. Unless this computational efficiency issue is solved, 3-D prestack migration methods based on downward continuation cannot compete with Kirchhoff methods. We address this problem by presenting a method for downward continuing common‐azimuth data in the original 4-D space of the common‐azimuth data geometry. The method is based on a new common‐azimuth downward‐continuation operator derived by a stationary‐phase approximation of the full 3-D prestack downward‐continuation operator expressed in the frequency‐wavenumber domain. Although the new common‐azimuth operator is exact only for constant velocity, a ray‐theoretical interpretation of the stationary‐phase approximation enables us to derive an accurate generalization of the method to media with both vertical and lateral velocity variations. The proposed migration method successfully imaged a synthetic data set that was generated assuming strong lateral and vertical velocity gradients. The common‐azimuth downward‐continuation theory also can be applied to the derivation of a computationally efficient constant‐velocity Stolt migration of common‐azimuth data. The Stolt migration formulation leads to the important theoretical result that constant‐velocity common‐azimuth migration can be split into two exact sequential migration processes: 2-D prestack migration along the inline direction, followed by 2-D zero‐offset migration along the cross‐line direction.",10.1190/1.1444098
Incorporating Mechanisms Of Fluid Pressure Relaxation Into Inclusion‐Based Models Of Elastic Wave Velocities,"Our new method incorporates fluid pressure communication into inclusion‐based models of elastic wave velocities in porous rocks by defining effective elastic moduli for fluid‐filled inclusions. We illustrate this approach with two models: (1) flow between nearest‐neighbor pairs of inclusions and (2) flow through a network of inclusions that communicates fluid pressure throughout a rock sample. In both models, we assume that pore pressure gradients induce laminar flow through narrow ducts, and we give expressions for the effective bulk moduli of inclusions. We compute P‐wave velocities and attenuation in a model sandstone and illustrate that the dependence on frequency and water‐saturation agrees qualitatively with laboratory data. We consider levels of water saturation from 0 to 100% and all wavelengths much larger than the scale of material heterogeneity, obtaining near‐exact agreement with Gassmann theory at low frequencies and exact agreement with inclusion‐based models at high frequencies.",10.1190/1.1598110

International Scientific Co‐Operation,"The gradual casing of restrictions on travel and on the general release of scientific discoveries has made it practicable once more to arrange international meetings of men of science. The general Assembly of the International Council of Scientific Unions will meet in London on July 22–24, 1946. Meanwhile its Executive Committee has held a meeting in London attended by representatives of most of the International Unions adhering to the Council.",10.1190/1.1486524
A Simple Method Of Predicting S-Wave Velocity,"Prediction of shear-wave velocity plays an important role in seismic modeling, amplitude analysis with offset, and other exploration applications. This paper presents a method for predicting S-wave velocity from the P-wave velocity on the basis of the moduli of dry rock. Elastic velocities of water-saturated sediments at low frequencies can be predicted from the moduli of dry rock by using Gassmann's equation; hence, if the moduli of dry rock can be estimated from P-wave velocities, then S-wave velocities easily can be predicted from the moduli. Dry rock bulk modulus can be related to the shear modulus through a compaction constant. The numerical results indicate that the predicted S-wave velocities for consolidated and unconsolidated sediments agree well with measured velocities if differential pressure is greater than approximately   5 MPa  . An advantage of this method is that there are no adjustable parameters to be chosen, such as the pore-aspect ratios required in some other methods. The predicted S-wave velocity depends only on the measured P-wave velocity and porosity.",10.1190/1.2357833
An Improved Pulse Transient Airborne Electromagnetic System For Locating Good Conductors,"Measuring the transient field values (H), rather than their time derivatives (dH/dt), with an inductive, pulse‐excited electromagnetic prospecting system makes the device capable of reducing much of the geologic noise due to poor superficial conductors and enhancing the response from good conductors. The factor of improvement in signal‐to‐geologic noise ratio in H measurement may be as much as λ¯s/λ¯n, where λ¯s, and λ¯n are the expected values of decay time constant of signal and noise components, respectively. Moreover, signal‐to‐noise ratio increases for later sample channels, thus allowing equal gate timings for all sample channels. Field results of a comparative study with H and dH/dt measurements are shown. It is predicted that both depth of exploration and reliability of interpretation of data in quantitative terms may improve somewhat with such a system.",10.1190/1.1440617
"Frequency‐Domain Acoustic‐Wave Modeling And Inversion Of Crosshole Data: Part Ii—Inversion Method, Synthetic Experiments And Real‐Data Results","In full‐wave inversion of seismic data in complex media it is desirable to use finite differences or finite elements for the forward modeling, but such methods are still prohibitively expensive when implemented in 3-D. Full‐wave 2-D inversion schemes are of limited utility even in 2-D media because they do not model 3-D dynamics correctly. Many seismic experiments effectively assume that the geology varies in two dimensions only but generate 3-D (point source) wavefields; that is, they are ""two‐and‐one‐half‐dimensional"" (2.5-D), and this configuration can be exploited to model 3-D propagation efficiently in such media. We propose a frequency domain full‐wave inversion algorithm which uses a 2.5-D finite difference forward modeling method. The calculated seismogram can be compared directly with real data, which allows the inversion to be iterated. We use a descents‐related method to minimize a least‐squares measure of the wavefield mismatch at the receivers. The acute nonlinearity caused by phase‐wrapping, which corresponds to time‐domain cycle‐skipping, is avoided by the strategy of either starting the inversion using a low frequency component of the data or constructing a starting model using traveltime tomography. The inversion proceeds by stages at successively higher frequencies across the observed bandwidth. The frequency domain is particularly efficient for crosshole configurations and also allows easy incorporation of attenuation, via complex velocities, in both forward modeling and inversion. This also requires the introduction of complex source amplitudes into the inversion as additional unknowns. Synthetic studies show that the iterative scheme enables us to achieve the theoretical maximum resolution for the velocity reconstruction and that strongly attenuative zones can be recovered with reasonable accuracy. Preliminary results from the application of the method to a real data set are also encouraging.",10.1190/1.1443818
The Effect Of Systematic Diagenetic Changes On The Mechanical Behavior Of A Quartz-Cemented Sandstone,"A key goal of petrophysical studies of sandstones is to relate common field measurements, particularly seismic or sonic velocities, to parameters defining the rock's mechanical and hydrologic characteristics. These include elastic and inelastic mechanical properties, porosity, and permeability. We explored relationships among these properties in variably quartz-cemented, mature arenites of the St. Peter Sandstone with porosities ranging from 9% to 25%. In a previous paper, we described microstructural changes accompanying progressive quartz cementation and related porosity and permeability reduction in this sample suite. Here, we report ultrasonic velocities ultrasonic velocities, dynamic and static elastic properties, confined compressive strength, and tensile strength. Analyses of these data demonstrated that factors controlling permeability also fundamentally determined the elastic and inelastic mechanical properties. We found that the number of grain contacts, or bonds, per number of grains viewed in the thin section (bond-to-grain ratio [BGR]) was a key predictive parameter of the mechanical and hydrologic properties. Although the contact length and number of contacts correlated well with the mechanical behavior, statistical analyses showed that BGR was a better predictor of strength, elastic stiffness, and fluid transport properties than was the contact length. The BGR provided a measure of the pore throat occlusion that reduced permeability and the connectivity of the grain framework that stiffened and strengthened the rock. Because porosity and BGR were typically well correlated, porosity was a more quickly and easily measured proxy for BGR in this case. However, our analysis showed that it was the microstructural changes associated with porosity loss rather than porosity loss per se that largely controlled the properties of interest. Thus, consideration of BGR as well as the relative strengths of grains and bond type (cement, pressure solution) for different compositions of sandstone and cement may constructively form the basis for comparative studies of other more complex sandstones.",10.1190/geo2014-0026.1
Temperature Dependence Of The Electrical Resistivity Of Water‐Saturated Rocks,"The electrical resistivities of several dacitic tuffs, sandstone, andesite, granite, and crystalline limestone samples, saturated with a 0.001 M aqueous solution of KC𝓁;, were measured in the range from room temperature to 250°C. The experiments were made using a cell technique with platinum electrodes. Of particular interest are the data collected at temperatures above 200°C under high pressure, a region scarcely documented in the literature. Basically the samples used in the present study show a quasi‐exponential decrease of resistivity with temperature up to 200°C. The same temperature dependence is found for the resistivity of the saturating solution, thus confirming that conduction in water‐saturated rocks is essentially electrolytic. At temperatures above 200°C, some specimens of highly porous dacitic tuff still closely follow the saturating solution in the pattern of resistivity variation with temperature, exhibiting a minimum around 220°C; however, the behavior of low‐porosity crystalline rocks (notably granite) where a relatively abrupt decrease of resistivity is observed above 50°C, departs from that of the saturating solution. Hysteresis phenomena are more or less observed in most rock samples; i.e., the resistivity after one complete thermal cycle is systematically lower than its initial value. This experimental evidence points out that mechanisms different from water characteristics, such as growth of microcracks or chemical reactions, contribute to electrical conduction at high temperature. We point out the electrical signature of the thermally induced growth of microcracks (thermal cracking) in welded tuff and granite and suggest the possibility of using electrical measurements to monitor an extension of reservoir fractures in hot dry rock.",10.1190/1.1442869
Seismoelectromagnetic Homogeneous Space Green'S Functions,"We have developed explicit expressions and the corresponding computer code for all homogeneous space Green's functions for coupled electromagnetic fields and poroelastic waves. The Green's functions are derived from the basic equations in closed form in the wavenumber- and space-frequency domains. They are given for point sources of any type. This adds several Green's functions to what has been published before. These Green's functions can be used in integral equation formulations, for numerical model validation, and for studying earthquake-related electrokinetic effects. The wavenumber domain code for all Green's functions is given with the numerical test on the basic equations to demonstrate correctness. The numerical codes to compute them in the space-frequency domain are also given. A numerical inverse fast Fourier transformation routine is used to provide space-time domain results. At seismic frequencies, the fast P-wave is radiated with the largest amplitude in all fields, except for the magnetic fields where no P-waves are generated. At ultrasonic frequencies and in the particle and filtration velocity fields generated by an electric current source, the slow P-wave has the strongest amplitude. In the filtration velocity and particle velocity, the slow P-wave is, respectively, three orders and one order of magnitude stronger than the fast P-wave.",10.1190/geo2015-0337.1
Frequency‐Dependent Q‐Estimation Of Love‐Type Channel Waves And The Application Of Q‐Correction To Seismograms,"We present the absorption dispersion relation of Love‐type channel waves for a simple, symmetric, homogenous, three‐layered, linear elastic model assuming that the quality factors of coal (Qs1) and country rock (Qs2) are constant. We introduce complex propagation functions into the known dispersion relation describing most of the properties of the Love‐ type channel waves. The complex dispersion relation is expanded into power series of Qs2-1, Qs2-1, and Qα-1 (Qα‐quality factor of the Love‐type channel wave). The real part of the ensuing dispersion relation gives the usual dispersion relation. The imaginary part yields the frequency relation between the quality factor of Love‐type channel waves and the constant quality factors of coal and rock. In this case, Qα depends on the frequency because the phase velocity is a function of frequency. Therefore, the attenuation coefficient is a nonlinear function of frequency. The analysis of the analytical result shows that at high frequencies the Love‐type channel wave energy is completely propagating inside the coal seam, and hence its propagation is determined by the physical properties of the coal alone. As the frequency approaches zero, the Love‐type channel wave energy is completely propagating in the rock, since the thickness of the coal is small compared to the wavelength of the channel wave, and hence the channel wave does not ""see"" the coal seam. The spectral ratio method is used to estimate the frequency‐dependent quality factor Qα of Love‐type channel waves. This technique is demonstrated by applying it first to synthetic data and then to data of a well‐designed transmission survey. Finally, we use the estimated Qα to derive an inverse Q‐operator and apply it for Q‐correction to both data sets.",10.1190/1.1443911
Three‐Dimensional Filtering With An Array Of Seismometers,"The development of the Wiener linear least‐mean‐square‐error processing theory for seismic signal enhancement through use of a two‐dimensional array of seismometers leads to the theory of three‐dimensional filtering. The array processing system for this theory consists of applying individual frequency filters to the outputs of the seismometers in the array before summation. The basic design equations for the optimum frequency filters are derived from the Wiener multichannel theory. However, the development of the three‐dimensional frequency and vector‐wave‐number‐filtering theory results in a physical understanding of generalized linear array processing. The three‐dimensional filtering theory is illuminated by a theoretical problem of P‐wave enhancement in the presence of ambient seismic noise. An analysis of the results shows why optimum three‐dimensional filtering gives greater signal‐to‐noise ratio improvements than achieved by conventional array processing techniques.",10.1190/1.1439406
Reservoir Property Prediction Using Abductive Networks,"Statistical methods, such as linear regression and neural networks, are commonly used to predict reservoir properties from seismic attributes. However, a huge number of attributes can be extracted from seismic data and an efficient method for selecting an attribute subset with the highest correlation to the property being predicted is essential. Most statistical methods, however, lack an optimized approach for this attribute selection. We propose to predict reservoir properties from seismic attributes using abductive networks, which use iterated polynomial regression to derive high-degree polynomial predictors. The abductive networks simultaneously select the most relevant attributes and construct an optimal nonlinear predictor. We applied the approach to predict porosity from seismic data of an area within the 'Uthmaniyah portion of the Ghawar oil field, Saudi Arabia. The data consisted of normal seismic amplitude, acoustic impedance, 16 other seismic attributes, and porosity logs from seven wells located in the study area. Out of 27 attributes, the abductive network selected only the best two to six attributes and produced a more accurate and robust porosity prediction than using the more common neural-network predictors. In addition, the proposed method requires no effort in choosing the attribute subset or tweaking their parameters.",10.1190/1.3298443
"Occam'S Inversion To Generate Smooth, Two‐Dimensional Models From Magnetotelluric Data","Magnetotelluric (MT) data are inverted for smooth 2-D models using an extension of the existing 1-D algorithm, Occam's inversion. Since an MT data set consists of a finite number of imprecise data, an infinity of solutions to the inverse problem exists. Fitting field or synthetic electromagnetic data as closely as possible results in theoretical models with a maximum amount of roughness, or structure. However, by relaxing the misfit criterion only a small amount, models which are maximally smooth may be generated. Smooth models are less likely to result in overinterpretation of the data and reflect the true resolving power of the MT method. The models are composed of a large number of rectangular prisms, each having a constant conductivity. Apriori information, in the form of boundary locations only or both boundary locations and conductivity, may be included, providing a powerful tool for improving the resolving power of the data. Joint inversion of TE and TM synthetic data generated from known models allows comparison of smooth models with the true structure. In most cases, smoothed versions of the true structure may be recovered in 12–16 iterations. However, resistive features with a size comparable to depth of burial are poorly resolved. Real MT data present problems of non‐Gaussian data errors, the breakdown of the two‐dimensionality assumption and the large number of data in broadband soundings; nevertheless, real data can be inverted using the algorithm.",10.1190/1.1442813
The Microlog Continuous Dipmeter,"Some of the methods used at the present time for determining the angle and the azimuth of the dip in the formations traversed by a borehole are based on correlations between three curves recording certain electrical characteristics of the formations, such as SP or resistivity, along the wall of the borehole in three equally spaced azimuths. With the conventional equipment used for the application of these methods, the measurements are made over separate intervals of depth. In the present paper, a new improved instrument called the MicroLog Continuous Dipmeter is described, wherein the three curves used for the determination of the dip are obtained with three MicroLog devices and wherein these three curves—as well as the orientation of the instrument and the inclination of the borehole—are simultaneously and continuously recorded. It is shown that with the help of this instrument more numerous dip determinations can be made in a given well with a higher accuracy and a greater recording speed. The paper is illustrated with field examples.",10.1190/1.1437947
The Effect Of Confining Pressure On Elastic Wave Velocities And Dynamic To Static Young'S Modulus Ratio,"We carried out laboratory experiments under dry conditions on limestone core specimens of Sarvak formation obtained from an oil well in the southwest of Iran. Our objective was to study the effect of confining pressure on the compressional and shear wave velocities (VP, VS), and on the dynamic to static Young's modulus ratio (Ed/Es). Furthermore, we made attempts to predict VP and VS at atmospheric pressure based on the same velocities at various confining pressures. These analyses revealed that, below a critical pressure with an increase in confinement VP and VS increased exponentially, representing a poroelastic regime. Above a critical pressure, however, the trend was linear. Likewise, we observed that with an increase in confinement, Ed/Es initially decreased exponentially, followed by a linear decreasing trend above the critical pressure. This indicated that Es is more responsive than Ed. Accordingly, these observations infer that it is possible to predict Es based on Ed at different confining stresses. This is an important improvement for geomechanical modeling of hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs because static parameters are more realistic input parameters. Besides, we derived the coefficients of the velocity-pressure equation for Sarvak limestone using least square regression analysis. More interestingly, we predicted VP and VS at atmospheric pressure based on these coefficients. Good agreement was observed between measured and predicted velocities at atmospheric pressure. Analysis of similar published experiments on oceanic basalts strongly confirmed these observations.",10.1190/geo2012-0279.1
"Linking Preferred Orientations To Elastic Anisotropy In Muderong Shale, Australia","The significance of shales for unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs, nuclear waste repositories, and geologic carbon storage has opened new research frontiers in geophysics. Among many of its unique physical properties, elastic anisotropy had long been investigated by experimental and computational approaches. Here, we calculated elastic properties of Cretaceous Muderong Shale from Australia with a self-consistent averaging method based on microstructural information. The volume fraction and crystallographic preferred orientation distributions of constituent minerals were based on synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments. Aspect ratios of minerals and pores, determined from scanning electron microscopy, were introduced in the self-consistent averaging. Our analysis suggested that phyllosilicates (i.e., illite-mica, illite-smectite, kaolinite, and chlorite) were dominant with ∼70  vol.%. The shape of clay platelets displayed an average aspect ratio of 0.05. These platelets were aligned parallel to the bedding plane with a high degree of preferred orientation. The estimated porosity at ambient pressure was ∼17  vol.% and was divided into equiaxial pores and flat pores with an average aspect ratio of 0.01. Our model gave results that compared satisfactorily with values derived from ultrasonic velocity measurements, confirming the validity and reliability of our approximations and averaging approach.",10.1190/geo2014-0236.1
Full-Azimuth Subsurface Angle Domain Wavefield Decomposition And Imaging Part I: Directional And Reflection Image Gathers,"We present a new subsurface angle-domain seismic imaging system for generating and extracting high-resolution information about subsurface angle-dependent reflectivity. The system enables geophysicists to use all recorded seismic data in a continuous fashion directly in the subsurface local angle domain (LAD), resulting in two complementary, full-azimuth, common-image-angle gather systems: directional and reflection. The complete set of information from both types of angle gathers leads to accurate, high-resolution, reliable velocity model determination and reservoir characterization. The directional angle decomposition enables the implementation of specular and diffraction imaging in real 3D isotropic/anisotropic geological models, leading to simultaneous emphasis on continuous structural surfaces and discontinuous objects such as faults and small-scale fractures. Structural attributes at each subsurface point, e.g., dip, azimuth and continuity, can be derived directly from the directional anglegathers. The reflection-angle gathers display reflectivity as a function of the opening angle and opening azimuth. These gathers are most meaningful in the vicinity of actual local reflecting surfaces, where the reflection angles are measured with respect to the derived background specular direction. The reflection-angle gathers are used for automatic picking of full-azimuth angle-domain residual moveouts (RMO) which, together with the derived background orientations of the subsurface reflection horizons, provide a complete set of input data to isotropic/anisotropic tomography. The full-azimuth, angle-dependent amplitude variations are used for reliable and accurate amplitude versus angle and azimuth (AVAZ) analysis and reservoir characterization. The proposed system is most effective for imaging and analysis below complex structures, such as subsalt and subbasalt, high-velocity carbonate rocks, shallow low-velocity gas pockets, and others. In addition, it enables accurate azimuthal anisotropic imaging and analysis, providing optimal solutions for fracture detection and reservoir characterization.",10.1190/1.3511352
Large-Scale 3D Geoelectromagnetic Modeling Using Parallel Adaptive High-Order Finite Element Method,"We have investigated the use of the adaptive high-order finite-element method (FEM) for geoelectromagnetic modeling. Because high-order FEM is challenging from the numerical and computational points of view, most published finite-element studies in geoelectromagnetics use the lowest order formulation. Solution of the resulting large system of linear equations poses the main practical challenge. We have developed a fully parallel and distributed robust and scalable linear solver based on the optimal block-diagonal and auxiliary space preconditioners. The solver was found to be efficient for high finite element orders, unstructured and nonconforming locally refined meshes, a wide range of frequencies, large conductivity contrasts, and number of degrees of freedom (DoFs). Furthermore, the presented linear solver is in essence algebraic; i.e., it acts on the matrix-vector level and thus requires no information about the discretization, boundary conditions, or physical source used, making it readily efficient for a wide range of electromagnetic modeling problems. To get accurate solutions at reduced computational cost, we have also implemented goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement. The numerical tests indicated that if highly accurate modeling results were required, the high-order FEM in combination with the goal-oriented local mesh refinement required less computational time and DoFs than the lowest order adaptive FEM.",10.1190/geo2015-0013.1
"High-Resolution Seismic Tracing Of The Transgression Across The Coastal Interface, Brigantine, New Jersey","We have repurposed high-resolution marine seismic profiles and vibracores collected from 1 to 10 km offshore Brigantine, New Jersey, to locate, characterize, and interpret the Holocene transgression across the land/sea interface. This storm-dominated, low-slope shelf had experienced large eustatic shifts during the late Pleistocene and Holocene, causing significant lowstand erosion during marine isotope stages (MIS) 6, 4, and 2, leaving fragmented sediment packages from the intervening highstands, which were further eroded by Holocene transgressive wave energy and submarine currents. Using sediment ages tied to seismic reflectors, we mapped the offshore surficial geology of the late Pleistocene and Holocene for the first time in this region. We tied the offshore geology to contiguous onshore surficial geology using borehole geophysical gamma logs, cores, and dated material from barrier-island, estuary, and salt-marsh environments, leading to several new findings, specifically (1) that a back-barrier marsh existed approximately 16 m below the present-day sea level and 7 km seaward of Little Egg Inlet 7960±210 (calibrated) before the present (AD 1950), (2) that shoal features were massed in a sediment prism south and west of Little Egg Inlet, and (3) as the Holocene sea level rose, Little Egg Inlet varied little from its current location, fixed in place by the incised valley of the paleo Mullica River, a major upland drainage system since at least MIS 6.",10.1190/geo2014-0101.1
Finite‐Difference Modeling Of Faults And Fractures,"For the purposes of seismic propagation, a slip fault may be regarded as a surface across which the displacement caused by a seismic wave is discontinuous while the stress traction remains continuous. The simplest assumption is that this slip and the stress traction are linearly related. Such a linear slip interface condition is easily modeled when the fault is parallel to the finite‐difference grid, but is more difficult to do for arbitrary nonplanar fault surfaces. To handle such situations we introduce equivalent medium theory to model material behavior in the cells of the finite‐ difference grid intersected by the fault. Virtually identical results were obtained from modeling the fault by (1) an explicit slip interface condition (fault parallel to the grid) and (2) using the equivalent medium theory when the finite‐difference grid was rotated relative to the fault and receiver array. No additional computation time is needed except for the preprocessing required to find the relevant cells and their associated moduli. The formulation is sufficiently general to include faults in and between arbitrary anisotropic materials with slip properties that vary as a function of position.",10.1190/1.1443884
3-D Avo Analysis And Modeling Applied To Fracture Detection In Coalbed Methane Reservoirs,"Over the years, amplitude variation with‐offset (AVO) analysis has been used successfully to predict reservoir properties and fluid contents, in some cases allowing the spatial location of gas‐water and gas‐oil contacts. In this paper, we show that a 3-D AVO technique also can be used to characterize fractured reservoirs, allowing spatial location of crack density variations. The Cedar Hill Field in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, produces methane from the fractured coalbeds of the Fruitland Formation. The presence of fracturing is critical to methane production because of the absence of matrix permeability in the coals. To help characterize this coalbed reservoir, a 3-D, multicomponent seismic survey was acquired in this field. In this study, prestack P‐wave amplitude data from the multicomponent data set are used to delineate zones of large Poisson's ratio contrasts (or high crack densities) in the coalbed methane reservoir, while source‐receiver azimuth sorting is used to detect preferential directions of azimuthal anisotropy caused by the fracturing system of coal. Two modeling techniques (using ray tracing and reflectivity methods) predict the effects of fractured coal‐seam zones on angle‐dependent P‐wave reflectivity. Synthetic common‐midpoint (CMP) gathers are generated for a horizontally layered earth model that uses elastic parameters derived from sonic and density log measurements. Fracture density variations in coalbeds are simulated by anisotropic modeling. The large acoustic impedance contrasts associated with the sandstone‐coal interfaces dominate the P‐wave reflectivity response. They far outweigh the effects of contrasts in anisotropic parameters for the computed models. Seismic AVO analysis of nine macrobins obtained from the 3-D volume confirms model predictions. Areas with large AVO intercepts indicate low‐velocity coals, possibly related to zones of stress relief. Areas with large AVO gradients identify coal zones of large Poisson's ratio contrasts and therefore high fracture densities in the coalbed methane reservoir. The 3-D AVO product and Poisson's variation maps combine these responses, producing a picture of the reservoir that includes its degree of fracturing and its possible stress condition. Source‐receiver azimuth sorting is used to detect preferential directions of azimuthal anisotropy caused by the fracturing system of coal.",10.1190/1.1444268
"Empirical Observations Relating Near‐Surface Magnetic Anomalies To High‐Frequency Seismic Data And Landsat Data In Eastern Sheridan County, Montana","Our empirical synergistic correlations of aeromagnetic and seismic data and a Landsat lineament interpretation revealed lineations on the magnetic map that have expression on seismic sections. We observed a conjugate set of northwest‐southeast and northeast‐southwest trending magnetic lineaments (zones which offset and truncate near‐surface magnetic anomalies). We believe these OZs (offset zones) represent lateral faults in a wrench‐fault system. Lateral offsets appear to be 100s of meters to a few kilometers (fractions of a mile to a few miles). We observed a direct correlation between OZs and vertical faults in seismic data. Faults on seismic sections extend from near the surface to near the seismic basement. The faults are most pronounced in the Upper Cretaceous reflectors and seem to disappear with depth. Fault throws are inconsistent (reversing throw across faults). OZs trend northeast‐southwest in the north half of the study area and both northeast‐southwest and northwest‐southeast in the south half. The OZ direction of northeast‐southwest in the north half of the survey is confirmed with seismic data. The northwest‐southeast seismic line contains numerous faults and the northeast‐southwest seismic line contains few faults. Most northeast‐southwest faults do not appear to reach seismic basement and are not seen in an interpretation of the magnetic basement. In two cases, northwest‐southeast OZs and correlative Landsat lineaments coincide with mapped magnetic basement faults. These magnetic basement faults can be seen in seismic data too. Faults trending northwest‐southeast may represent Precambrian faults reactivated during the Laramide Orogeny. Movement along these faults possibly generated the northeast‐southwest faults. Most oil fields have an associated near‐surface magnetic anomaly. Other near‐surface magnetic anomalies occur over obvious, untested (in 1985), seismic character or amplitude anomalies in seismic events which correlate with producing intervals in the oil fields. This synergistic correlation is the most important single observation from our study. Different data types and interpretation techniques identified the same geologic trends and prospective geographical areas. This fundamentally important information is often lost in bickering over which filter or processing technique to use or in arguments over which data type is ""more important"" than others. Further, if the synergistic correlation of data types were not done, the importance of the anomalous features in each individual data type may not have been recognized.",10.1190/1.1442966
Velocity Analysis For Tilted Transversely Isotropic Media: A Physical Modeling Example,"Transverse isotropy with a tilted symmetry axis (TTI media) has been recognized as a common feature of shale formations in overthrust areas, such as the Canadian Foothills. Since TTI layers cause serious problems in conventional imaging, it is important to be able to reconstruct the velocity model suitable for anisotropic depth migration. Here, we discuss the results of anisotropic parameter estimation on a physical‐modeling data set. The model represents a simplified version of a typical overthrust section from the Alberta Foothills, with a horizontal reflector overlaid by a bending transversely isotropic layer. Assuming that the TTI layer is homogeneous and the symmetry axis stays perpendicular to its boundaries, we invert P-wave normal‐moveout (NMO) velocities and zero‐offset traveltimes for the symmetry‐direction velocity V0 and the anisotropic parameters ε and δ. The coefficient ε is obtained using the traveltimes of a wave that crosses a dipping TTI block and reflects from the bottom of the model. The inversion for ε is based on analytic expressions for NMO velocity in media with intermediate dipping interfaces. Our estimates of both anisotropic coefficients are close to their actual values. The errors in the inversion, which are associated primarily with the uncertainties in picking the NMO velocities and traveltimes, can be reduced by a straighforward modification of the acquisition geometry. It should be emphasized that the moveout inversion also gives an accurate estimate of the thickness of the TTI layer, thus reconstructing the correct depth scale of the section. Although the physical model used here was relatively simple, our results demonstrate the principal feasibility of anisotropic velocity analysis and imaging in overthrust areas. The main problems in anisotropic processing for TTI models are likely to be caused by the lateral variation of the velocity field and overall structural complexity.",10.1190/1.1444980
Generalized Hilbert Transforms Of The Effect Of Single Magnetic Sources,"The generalized Hilbert transforms of potential fields, particularly magnetic fields, provide a useful resource for improving interpretation. Even though x- and y-Hilbert transforms of a potential field on a plane can be approximately computed from the whole observed field, they are locally independent of the observations when working on reduced areas of the plane, and therefore, on those areas, Hilbert transforms can be combined with them to better constrain and stabilize local inversions. Extended Euler deconvolution, based on Euler's homogeneity equation, makes extensive use of this principle. We investigated closed-form expressions for evaluating in the space domain the generalized x- and y-Hilbert transforms of magnetic fields generated by single point sources, given in the form of dipoles, monopoles, and Newtonian potential type sources. Apart from providing a way to calculate Hilbert transforms via equivalent sources, this approach, adding little computer effort, can be applied to solve local inverse problems as a way to improve the definition of a model previous to an inversion over a large area; the solution is modeled by point sources, and it enables matching not only the observations, but also the Hilbert transforms, thus providing stronger constraints. A synthetic example with noisy data demonstrated the resolving power of this approach in locally inverting for magnetization intensities of prismatic bodies using data windows either above or displaced from the sources. In an example from a magnetic anomaly over Sierra de San Luis, Argentina, the magnetization intensities of the basement are locally inverted for at each solution point of an extended Euler deconvolution. Results indicated a more coherent pattern when the Hilbert transforms were incorporated to the inversion, illustrating how local inversions with Hilbert transforms, which do not involve time-consuming operations, can accompany extended Euler deconvolutions to better outline characteristics of a model.",10.1190/geo2011-0188.1
An Angle-Domain Imaging Condition For Elastic Reverse Time Migration And Its Application To Angle Gather Extraction,"An angle-domain imaging condition is recommended for multicomponent elastic reverse time migration. The local slant stack method is used to separate source and receiver waves into P- and S-waves and simultaneously decompose them into local plane waves along different propagation directions. We calculated the angle-domain partial images by crosscorrelating every possible combination of the incident and scattered plane P- and S-waves and then organized them into P-P and P-S local image matrices. Local image matrix preserves all the angle information related to the seismic events. Thus, by working in the image matrix, it is convenient to perform different angle-domain operations (e.g., filtering artifacts, correcting polarity, or conducting illumination and acquisition aperture compensations). Because local image matrix is localized in space, these operations can be designed to be highly flexible, e.g., target-oriented, dip-angle-dependent or reflection-angle-dependent. After performing angle-domain operations, we can stack the partial images in the local image matrix to generate the depth image, or partially sum them up to produce different angle-domain common image gathers, which can be used for amplitude versus angle and migration velocity analysis. We tested several numerical examples to demonstrate the applications of this angle-domain image condition. ",10.1190/geo2011-0455.1

Cooperative Inversion Of Geophysical Data,"Geophysical inversion by iterative modeling involves fitting observations by adjusting model parameters. Both seismic and potential‐field model responses can be influenced by the adjustment of the parameters of the rock properties. The objective of this ""cooperative inversion"" is to obtain a model which is consistent with all available surface and borehole geophysical data. Although inversion of geophysical data is generally non‐unique and ambiguous, we can lessen the ambiguities by inverting all available surface and borehole data. This paper illustrates this concept with a case history in which surface seismic data, sonic logs, surface gravity data, and borehole gravity meter (BHGM) data are adequately modeled by using least‐squares inversion and a series of forward modeling steps.",10.1190/1.1442403
Constant Q Attenuation Of Subsurface Radar Pulses,"Q is a measure of the energy stored to the energy dissipated in a propagating wave and can be estimated from the ratio of attenuation and frequency. For seismic waves, Q has been found to be essentially independent of frequency. As a result, attenuation is an approximately linear function of frequency and the impulse response function of the earth. Hence, the distortion of a seismic pulse as it propagates can be described by a single parameter. Laboratory measurements show that the attenuation of radio waves in some geological materials can also be approximated by a linear function of frequency over the bandwidths of typical subsurface radar pulses. We define a new parameter Q* to describe the slope of this linear region. The impulse response of the transfer function for a given value of Q* differs from that of the same value of Q only in total amplitude. Thus the change of shape of a radar pulse as it travels through these materials can also be described by a single parameter. The constant Q* model successfully describes the distortion of radar pulses propagated through a laboratory water tank and through weathered granite in a borehole field study.",10.1190/1.1443677
Noniterative Nonlinear Gravity Inversion,"To obtain the shape of a homogeneous body from its gravity anomalies, the inverse of Parker's formula is expressed here by means of a power series expansion in the reciprocal of the density contrast. The calculation of the nth coefficient of the series needs the evaluation of n-1 Fourier transforms of products and sums of the preceding coefficients and a sufficient storage to contain all of them. Computer time is modest for the first several terms, but grows rapidly as the number of terms increases. Fortunately, most inversions require a small number of terms. The method reproduces Oldenburg's iteration results exactly and faster whenever it converges, and it can also converge in other cases. Nevertheless, its main advantage comes from the fact that once the series coefficients have been computed, the inversion can be performed immediately for a variety of density contrasts, allowing the choice of best values to match constraints such as seismic or borehole data.",10.1190/1.1443484
Characterization Of Fluid Transport Properties Of Reservoirs Using Induced Microseismicity,"We systematically describe an approach to estimate the large‐scale permeability of reservoirs using seismic emission (microseismicity) induced by fluid injection. We call this approach seismicity‐based reservoir characterization (SBRC). A simple variant of the approach is based on the hypothesis that the triggering front of hydraulically‐induced microseismicity propagates like a diffusive process (pore pressure relaxation) in an effective homogeneous anisotropic poroelastic fluid‐saturated medium. The permeability tensor of this effective medium is the permeability tensor upscaled to the characteristic size of the seismically active heterogeneous rock volume. We show that in a homogeneous medium the surface of the seismicity triggering front has the same form as the group‐velocity surface of thelow‐frequency anisotropic, second‐type Biots wave describing kinematic aspects of triggering‐front propagation in a way similar to the eikonal equation for seismic wavefronts. In the case of isotropic heterogeneous media, the inversion for the hydraulic properties of rocks follows from a direct application of this equation. In the case of an anisotropic heterogeneous medium, only the magnitude of a global effective permeability tensor can be mapped in a 3‐D spatial domain. We demonstrate the method on several field examples and also test the eikonal equation‐based inversion.",10.1190/1.1451597
Computational Methods For Large-Scale 3D Acoustic Finite-Difference Modeling: A Tutorial,"We present a set of methods for modeling wavefields in three dimensions with the acoustic-wave equation. The primary applications of these modeling methods are the study of acquisition design, multiple suppression, and subsalt imaging for surface-streamer and ocean-bottom recording geometries. We show how to model the acoustic wave equation in three dimensions using limited computer memory, typically using a single workstation, leading to run times on the order of a few CPU hours to a CPU day. The structure of the out-of-core method presented is also used to improve the efficiency of in-core modeling, where memory-to-cache-to-memory data flow is essentially the same as the data flow for an out-of-core method. Starting from the elastic-wave equation, we develop a vector-acoustic algorithm capable of efficiently modeling multicomponent data in an acoustic medium. We show that data from this vector-acoustic algorithm can be used to test upgoing/downgoing separation of P-waves recorded by ocean-bottom seismic acquisition.",10.1190/1.2753753
Response By J. Roy To The Reply By The Authors,"On platform attitude measurement: The integration of platform attitude measurements with existing geophysical platforms was done regularly in all airborne geophysical platforms equipped with the Geonics EM‐18 VLF system where roll and pitch compensation was done with a gyroscope‐derived signal (Geonics 1982 Catalog, EM‐18 data sheet). Also, the integration of full platform attitude measurement (pitch, yaw, and roll) with a geophysical platform was done as an example by SGC. Their platform carried, among others, a three‐component magnetometer (SGC TRIX‐03 data sheet) and a RAMA‐style VLF system (Granar, 1981). Pendulum‐based systems have also been used in both fixed wing aircrafts and helicopter towed birds. Current developments in platform attitude measurements include multiple GPS antennas and receivers with measuring tolerances lower than one degree (among others, NASA, 1992).",10.1190/1.1486694
Theoretical Transforms Of The Gravity Anomalies Of Two Idealized Bodies,"Odegard and Berg (1965) have shown that the interpretational process can be simplified for several idealized bodies by utilizing the Fourier transform of the resultant theoretical gravity anomalies. Additional studies relating similar conclusions for other idealized bodies have been reported by Gladkii (1963), Roy (1967), Sharma et al (1970), Davis (1971), Eby (1972), and Saha (1975), and a summary of the spatial and frequency domain equations is given in Regan and Hinze (1976, Table 1); however, the transforms of the three‐dimensional prism and vertical line elements, often utilized in interpretation, have not been previously examined in this manner. Although Bhattacharyya and Chen (1977) have developed and utilized the transform of the 3-D prism in their method for determining the distribution of magnetization in a localized region, it is still of value to present the interpretive advantages of the transform equation itself.",10.1190/1.1440842
Approximations To The Zoeppritz Equations And Their Use In Avo Analysis,"To efficiently invert seismic amplitudes for elastic parameters, pseudoquartic approximations to the Zoeppritz equations are derived to calculate P-P-wave reflection and transmission coefficients as a function of the ray parameter p. These explicit expressions have a compact form in which the coefficients of the p2 and p4 terms are given in terms of the vertical slownesses. The amplitude coefficients are also represented as a quadratic function of the elastic contrasts at an interface and are compared to the linear approximation used in conventional amplitude variation with offset (AVO) analysis, which can invert for only two elastic parameters. Numerical analysis with the second‐order approximation shows that the condition number of the Fréchet matrix for three elastic parameters is improved significantly from using a linear approximation. Therefore, those quadratic approximations can be used directly with amplitude information to estimate not only two but three parameters: P-wave velocity contrast, S-wave velocity contrast, and the ratio of S-wave and P-wave velocities at an interface.",10.1190/1.1444698
Analysis For Hydrocarbons In The Presence Of Nitrous Oxide,"The technique for the analysis of soil air for small quantities of hydrocarbons is reviewed. Various methods of expressing results and the basis for the calculation of each are given. Field data on expansion ratios are presented to show that there exists in the soil air a gas, other than the saturated hydrocarbons, which is not removed by the screening agents and is retained in the condensation trap. The reasons for believing that this gas is nitrous oxide are given, together with plausible sources of this gas in the soil air. Laboratory data are presented on the analysis of pure hydrocarbons in the presence and in the absence of this gas. Calculations made by each of the methods show that when results are based on after‐burning readings, a true measure of the hydrocarbon content is evolved, regardless of the presence of nitrous oxide.",10.1190/1.1445087
Changes In Shear‐Wave Polarization Azimuth With Depth In Cymric And Railroad Gap Oil Fields,"Shear‐wave (S-wave) polarization azimuths, although consistent over large depth intervals, changed abruptly and by large amount of various depths in nine-component vertical seismic profiling (VSP) data from the Cymric and Railroad Gap oil fields of the southwest San Joaquin basin. A simple layer‐stripping technique made it possible to follow the polarization changes and determine the S-wave birefringence over successive depth intervals. Because the birefringence and polarization azimuth are related to in‐situ stresses and fracture, information from such analysis could be important for reservoir development. Near offset VSP data from Cymrix indicated that the subsurface could be appproximated roughly as two anisotropic layers. The upper layer, from the surface to 800 ft (240 m), had vertical S-wave birefringence as large was about 6 percent down to 1300 ft (400 m). In the upper layer the polarization azimuth of the fast S-wave was N 60°E, while in the lower layer it was about N 10°E. Refinement of the layer stripping showed that neither layer was anisotropically homogenous, and both could be subdivided into thinner layers. Near offset S-wave VSP data from the Railroad Gap well also show high birefringence near the surface and less birefringence deeper. In the uppermost layer, which extends down to 1300 ft (400 m), the S-wave birefringence was 9 percent, and the lag between the fast and slow S-waves exceeded 60 ms at the bottom of the layer. Seven layers in all were needed to accommodate S-wave polarization changes. The most reliable azimuth angle determination as judged from the data consistency were those of the uppermost layer, at N 46°E, and those from depths 2900–3700 ft (880–1130 m) and 3900–5300 ft (1190–1610 m), at N 16°E and N 15°W, respectively. Over those intervals the scatter of calculated azimuths about the mean was typically less than 4 degrees. The largest birefringence at both locations occurred in the same formation, the Pliocene Tulare sands and Pebble Conglomerate. In those formations the azimuth of the fast S-wave polarization was roughly orthogonal to the southwest. In the deeper Antelope shale, S-wave polarization directions in both areas were close to 45 degrees from the fault. Confidence in the layer stripping procedure was bolstered by major improvement in data quality that resulted from stripping. Before stripping, wavelets of the two S-waves sometimes had very different waveforms, and it was often impossible to come close to diagonalizing the 2 × 2 S‐wave data matrix by rotating sources and receivers by the same angle. After stripping, wavelets were more similar in shape, and the S‐wave matrix was more nearly diagonalizable by rotating with a single angle.",10.1190/1.1443155
Resolution In Seismic Trace Inversion By Parameter Estimation,"An alternative to the conventional time series approach to single‐trace modeling and inversion by convolution and inverse filtering is a parametric approach. To obtain insight into the potential of the parametric approach, the solution of the single‐trace forward problem is formulated in matrix terms. For the nonlinear reflector lag time parameters this is achieved by linearization, which is shown to be a valid approximation over a sufficiently large region. The matrix forward operators are analyzed by means of the singular value decomposition (SVD). The SVD can be considered a generalization of the Fourier transform of convolution operators. On the basis of the SVD analysis, inverse operators are designed which combine stability with high resolving power. A method to determine the resolving power of the parametric inverse operators is presented. Several examples show how wavelet bandwidth, data noise level, and model complexity influence the resolving power of the data for the reflection coefficient and the lag‐time parameters. The most important result is that the resolution obtained in parametric inversion is, in most cases, superior to and, at worst, equal to the resolution obtained with wavelet inverse filtering. The explanation is that in parametric inversion a different representation of the reflectivity function is used which, in practical situations, involves fewer unknowns. In wavelet inverse filtering the reflectivity function is represented as a regularly sampled function where every sample point represents an unknown. In practical applications of parametric inversion the reflectivity function is represented as a model with a limited number of reflectors as unknowns. To formulate parametric models, a priori information is required. The effort of collecting sufficient a priori information is the cost of increasing resolution beyond the resolution offered by wavelet inverse filtering.",10.1190/1.1442012
Physical Properties Of Titanomagnetite Sands,"Laboratory measurements of density, magnetic susceptibility, remanence, resistivity, and induced‐polarization response of New Zealand titanomagnetite sands (""ironsands"") were made for different volume concentrations Cv of titanomagnetite in the range 10 to 100 percent. Both density ρ and magnetic susceptibility κ of these sands increase monotonically with Cv; the observed variation of κ as a function of Cv can be explained by changes of the resultant relative magnetic permeability μ of a binary mixture of magnetic and nonmagnetic grains. The natural remanence of titanomagnetite sands is small (Koenigsberger ratio Q  0.2). No significant induced‐polarization response could be observed even for mixtures of almost pure titanomagnetite. When placed in an electric field, the titanomagnetite sands were found to be nonconductive.",10.1190/1.1441089
Maximum Entropy Spectral Decomposition Of A Seismogram Into Its Minimum Entropy Component Plus Noise,"We consider an N‐layered elastic medium which is perfectly insulated from its embedding space. Each layer has unit two‐way vertical traveltime, and a coincident source‐receiver pair is located just below the top interface. If the insulated medium is excited in the remote past, the power spectrum of the resulting impulsive normal‐incidence synthetic seismogram is a pure line spectrum; because no random elements exist in the system at the time of measurement, this spectrum is a minimum entropy spectrum. If we add white noise to the seismogram, the power spectrum becomes a maximum entropy spectrum. The maximum entropy spectrum can thus be decomposed into the sum of a minimum entropy spectrum plus white noise; this spectral decomposition is due to Pisarenko (1973). If the insulated medium is excited at time t = 0, the resulting synthetic seismogram differs rather remarkably from the seismogram obtained for excitation in the remote past.",10.1190/1.1441251
Influence Of Displacement Currents On The Response Of Helicopter Electromagnetic Systems,"For the purpose of shallow-earth geophysical mapping, progressively higher frequencies have been developed for helicopter electromagnetic (HEM) systems. However, concern has been expressed about the vulnerability of high-frequency EM signals to the influence of the displacement current, especially the phase shift of the HEM signal resulting from the finite speed of light that describes the propagation of the EM wave in free space. In this paper we investigate the influence of the displacement current and the finite speed of light on HEM responses, based on a full solution of the EM field for a conductive, magnetically, and  dielectrically polarizable earth half-space and an overlying half-space of air with free-space dielectric permittivity. We calculate the amplitude change and the phase shift of the HEM signal and the change in the apparent resistivity. We find that the displacement current, when both the air and the earth half-space assume the free-space dielectric permittivity, has a small influence on the HEM signal, while substantial influence may occur when the earth is dielectrically polarizable. The finite speed of the EM propagation in free space does not result in significant phase changes in the HEM signal.",10.1190/1.1993710
Two‐Dimensional Circularly Symmetric Filter Design Via Coefficient Mapping,"Two‐dimensional (2-D) filters are used in geophysics for processing seismic, potential field, and remotely sensed data, and in other applied sciences for purposes such as image processing. These filters can be designed using optimum one‐dimensional (1-D) algorithms via mapping techniques: the 2-D desired response is mapped into the 1-D response either in the time domain or the frequency domain and mapped back after an approximation is obtained. A coefficient mapping algorithm is presented here for designing 2-D circularly symmetric filters. The 2-D frequency‐domain coefficients are mapped to the 1-D frequency axis after being sorted according to their distances from the origin. This kind of sorting brings together the coefficients of a particular passband, reject band, or transition band of the circularly symmetric filter before the coefficients are mapped into the 1-D frequency axis. As a result, there are as many prescribed bands in the 1-D domain as in the corresponding 2-D domain, which leads to optimal approximations in the 1-D domain and, consequently, in the 2-D domain. The mapping is performed between the Nyquist regions. A Chebychev or ""min‐max"" algorithm has been used for 1-D approximations. Due to a complete mapping between the 2-D and the 1-D domains, the 2-D filters designed via mapping show equiripple behavior similar to that of the 1-D filters. The new mapping algorithm is suitable for designing low‐pass, high‐pass, band‐pass, and band reject filters with multiple bands. The circular symmetries of the approximated responses improve with an increased number of filter coefficients. For a 2-D filter with N1×N2 coefficients, N1 and N2 must be odd; but they need not be equal. Applications of low‐pass and high‐pass circularly symmetric filters to data from a regional gravity field survey demonstrate that these filters can effectively separate anomalies of different wavelengths when there is no spectral overlap.",10.1190/1.1442664
Processing And Inversion Of Commercial Helicopter Time-Domain Electromagnetic Data For Environmental Assessments And Geologic And Hydrologic Mapping,"Helicopter time-domain electromagnetic (HTEM) surveying has historically been used for mineral exploration, but over the past decade it has started to be used in environmental assessments and geologic and hydrologic mapping. Such surveying is a cost-effective means of rapidly acquiring densely spaced data over large regions. At the same time, the quality of HTEM data can suffer from various inaccuracies. We developed an effective strategy for processing and inverting a commercial HTEM data set affected by uncertainties and systematic errors. The delivered data included early time gates contaminated by transmitter currents, noise in late time gates, and amplitude shifts between adjacent flights that appeared as artificial lineations in maps of the data and horizontal slices extracted from inversion models. Multiple processing steps were required to address these issues. Contaminated early time gates and noisy late time gates were semiautomatically identified and eliminated on a record-by-record basis. Timing errors between the transmitter and receiver electronics and inaccuracies in absolute amplitudes were corrected after calibrating selected HTEM data against data simulated from accurate ground-based TEM measurements. After editing and calibration, application of a quasi-3D spatially constrained inversion scheme significantly reduced the artificial lineations. Residual lineations were effectively eliminated after incorporating the transmitter and receiver altitudes and line-to-line amplitude factors in the inversion process. The final inverted model was very different from that generated from the original data provided by the contractor. For example, the average resistivity of the thick surface layer decreased from ∼1800 to ∼30  Ωm, the depths to the layer boundaries were reduced by 15%–23%, and the artificial lineations were practically eliminated. Our processing and inversion strategy is entirely general, such that with minor system-specific modifications it could be applied to any HTEM data set, including those recorded many years ago.",10.1190/geo2012-0452.1
A Robust Experimental Determination Of Thomsen'S Δ Parameter,"A novel inversion method for the laboratory determination of Thomsen's δ anisotropy parameter on cylindrical rock specimens from ultrasonic data has been recently reported in the literature. We further assessed this method through a direct comparison of the results of the traditional method (involving a single off-axis P-wave velocity measurement at 45°) and the new method (involving 65 P-wave velocity measurements at several angles to the symmetry axis). We prepared and characterized two vertical shale specimens from the same preserved vertical core to assess their similarity in terms of structure, mineralogy, porosity, and density. The shale was assumed to be transversely isotropic in view of the observed (horizontal) bedding. We subjected both specimens to the same brine saturation and effective stress state. Using the two methods, we obtained similar results for Thomsen's α (vertical P-wave) and ε (P-wave anisotropy) parameters. However, a significant discrepancy was observed for Thomsen's δ parameter: We obtained results of 0.13 using the new method and 0.39 using the traditional method. As a result of the overdetermined nature of the P-wave velocity measurements used in the new method, we believe that the corresponding δ value is more reliable. Also, the value derived with the new testing method seems to match more closely the reported field data.",10.1190/geo2014-0391.1
Sound Ranging In A Medium Having An Unknown Constant Phase Velocity,"A method for the sound ranging of explosions is described, in which the direction‐angle of the explosion is given in terms of the ratio of the differences in the arrival times at two pairs of microphones, geophones, or hydrophones. It is unnecessary to know either the phase‐velocity in the intervening medium or the absolute values of the time differences. However, the paths and the phase‐velocities must be such that the time differences are the same as they would be for a wave‐front traveling from explosion to the microphones at some constant velocity. A rapid graphical method for determining the location of the explosion is described. The precision of the determinations is discussed. Applications of the method to the scoring of bomb hits on bombing practice areas are suggested. The effect of the motion of the medium is considered.",10.1190/1.1437827
Comparison Of P‐ And S‐Wave Velocities And Q'S From Vsp And Sonic Log Data,"We compared P‐ and S‐wave velocities and quality factors (Q'S) from vertical seismic profiling (VSP) and sonic log measurements in five wells, three from the southwest San Joaquin Basin of California, one from near Laredo, Texas, and one from northern Alberta. Our purpose was to investigate the bias between sonic log and VSP velocities and to examine to what degree this bias might be a consequence of dispersion. VSPs and sonic logs were recorded in the same well in every case. Subsurface formations were predominantly clastic. The bias found was that VSP transit times were greater than sonic log times, consistent with normal dispersion. For the San Joaquin wells, differences in S‐wave transit times averaged 1–2 percent, while differences in P‐wave transit times averaged 6–7 percent. For the Alberta well, the situation was reversed, with differences in S‐wave transit times being about 6 percent, while those for P‐waves were 2.5 percent. For the Texas well, the differences averaged about 4 percent for both P‐ and S‐waves. Drift‐curve slopes for S‐waves tended to be low where the P‐wave slopes were high and vice versa. S‐wave drift‐curve slopes in the shallow California wells were 5–10 μs/ft (16–33 μs/m) and the P‐wave slopes were 15–30 μs/ft (49–98 μs/m). The S‐wave slope in sandstones in the northern Alberta well was up to 50 μs/ft (164 μs/m), while the P‐wave slope was about 5 μs/ft (16 μs/m). In the northern Alberta well the slopes for both P‐ and S‐waves flattened in the carbonate. In the Texas well, both P‐ and S‐wave drifts were comparable. We calculated (Q's) from a velocity dispersion formula and from spectral ratios. When the two Q's agreed, we concluded that velocity dispersion resulted solely from absorption. These Q estimation methods were reliable only for Q values smaller than 20. We found that, even with data of generally outstanding quality, Q values determined by standard methods can have large uncertainties, and negative Q's may be common.",10.1190/1.1443541
Repeatability Issues Of High-Frequency Signals Emitted By Air-Gun Arrays,"Recent field measurements of the acoustic signals generated by marine seismic air-gun arrays showed that the amount of high-frequency signals (above 10 kHz) increased with the size and total volume of the gun array. We found that for frequencies between 10 and 20 kHz, a strong signal is observed 7–14 ms after the main peak of the source signal. We believe that this signal was generated by ghost cavitation. We observed that this signal was significantly stronger than the high-frequency signal generated at the same time as the peak signal occurs within the bandwidth between 10 and 20 kHz. We found that this high-frequency signal was fairly repeatable from one shot to another. By ""fairly,"" we mean that individual high-frequency events were not repeatable; however, the envelope energy of this cascade of events was repeatable from one shot to another. The typical feature of the envelope of the high-frequency signal was that it lasted for approximately 6–7 ms and showed a monotonic increase in amplitude for the first 5–6 ms, followed by a sudden drop. The sea surface reflection coefficient for these high-frequency events seemed to decrease in magnitude as the frequency increased.",10.1190/geo2013-0142.1
Formation Resistivity Variation Due To Steam Flooding: A Log Study,"An investigation of the pre‐ and poststeam resistivity logs, in a production pattern in a heavy‐oil field in Southern California, shows that the formation resistivity in steamed formations decreases by a factor of two to three. Shales as well as sands are affected by the steam flood. The observed drop in the resistivity of the reservoir correlates well with the increase in temperature. The study shows the potential of using resistivity variations to map and monitor thermal enhanced oil recovery process.",10.1190/1.1443264
Amplitude Analysis With An Optimal Model-Based Linear Avo Approximation: Part I — Theory,"Linear equations used to approximate reflection coefficient-versus-angle curves are usually valid only for small seismic parameter changes across reflectors, and they are rather inaccurate close to the critical angle. These inaccuracies affect the quality of AVO analysis and cause systematic errors when estimating relative seismic-parameter variations at reflectors, especially for density. We present an optimal model-based approach to build more accurate linear AVO approximations. Their basis functions are calculated by applying singular value decomposition to realistic modeled AVO curves. By extending the validity range of linear approximations to larger angles, this approach helps when using information contained at near-critical offsets. It alsooffers several advantages in other situations. The basis functions of the new approximations are orthogonal. Their coefficients represent new AVO attributes that can be used either to classify AVO responses directly, or to obtain more accurate estimates of usual AVO attributes (intercept, gradient, and possibly a third coefficient). This leads to a better estimation of seismic-parameter contrasts at reflecting interfaces. These coefficients are naturally sorted in decreasing order of importance. Therefore, the proper number of terms in the proposed equations can be chosen easily to offer an optimal compromise between noise and the information carried by each coefficient. Synthetic tests confirm the robustness of the method. This flexible and robust approach will be particularly well adapted for three-parameter AVO analysis.",10.1190/1.2668600
Neural Networks In Geophysical Applications,"Neural networks are increasingly popular in geophysics. Because they are universal approximators, these tools can approximate any continuous function with an arbitrary precision. Hence, they may yield important contributions to finding solutions to a variety of geophysical applications. However, knowledge of many methods and techniques recently developed to increase the performance and to facilitate the use of neural networks does not seem to be widespread in the geophysical community. Therefore, the power of these tools has not yet been explored to their full extent. In this paper, techniques are described for faster training, better overall performance, i.e., generalization, and the automatic estimation of network size and architecture.",10.1190/1.1444797
True‐Amplitude Migration Taking Fine Layering Into Account,"The central process in wave‐equation—based depth migration is inverse wavefield extrapolation. The commonly applied matched filter approach to inverse wavefield extrapolation ignores the angle‐dependent amplitude and phase distortions that are related to fine layering. This may result in dispersed images and erroneous amplitude variation with angle of incidence (AVA) effects. ""Power reciprocity"" formulates a relation between transmitted and reflected wavefields. It provides the basis for a modified matched filter that does account for the aforementioned distortions. The correction term by which the matched filter is modified can be derived directly from the reflection data. With this modified matched filter, prestack depth migration will yield nondispersed images with correct AVA behavior.",10.1190/1.1444004
Seismic Traveltime Equations For Azimuthally Anisotropic And Isotropic Media: Estimation Of Interval Elastic Properties,"I derive analytical expressions giving traveltime‐offset curves for multilayered weakly azimuthally isotropic and anisotropic media on terms of the elastic properties of each layer. This method is based upon an approximate skewed hyperbolic moveout formula involving three measured bulk velocities for each reflector. The primary benefits of this technique are: (1) it allows for fast traveltime computation; (2) it makes possible an extremely rapid estimation of the interval elastic parameters; and (3) it provides physical insight into the wave propagation in anisotropic media. I establish a traveltime inversion algorithm which allows the estimation of the five elastic constants together with the orientation of the axis of symmetry for each layer. In the isotropic limit, this algorithm reduces to the conventional one used for determining the interval velocities from stacking velocity measurements in isotropic media. The inversion technique is applied to surface seismic measurements and VSP field surveys. In both cases, the method provides very good estimates of these six parameters, even in highly anisotropic materials. The results also show that the orientation of the horizontal axis of symmetry, for a given azimuthally anisotropic layer at depth, can be obtained using only quasi‐P‐wave information. This technique can be easily incorporated into conventional velocity analysis algorithms. Interval anisotropic properties can then be estimated with little additional effort.",10.1190/1.1443021
Virtual Shear Source Makes Shear Waves With Air Guns,"We demonstrate a novel application of the virtual source method to create shear-wave sources at the location of buried geophones. These virtual downhole sources excite shear waves with a different radiation pattern than known sources. They can be useful in various shear-wave applications. Here we focus on the virtual shear check shot to generate accurate shear-velocity profiles in offshore environments using typical acquisition for marine walkaway vertical seismic profiling (VSP). The virtual source method is applied to walkaway VSP data to obtain new traces resembling seismograms acquired with downhole seismic sources at geophone locations, thus bypassing any overburden complexity. The virtual sources can be synthesized to radiate predominantly shear waves by collecting converted-wave energy scattered throughout the overburden. We illustrate the concept in a synthetic layered model and demonstrate the method by estimating accurate P- and S-wave velocity profiles below salt using a walkaway VSP from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.",10.1190/1.2430563
Application Of The Pole‐Dipole Resistivity Technique To The Detection Of Solution Cavities Beneath Highways,"Using a multiconductor electrode cable and a 30‐post switching system, pole‐dipole electrical resistivity measurements with a linear electrode array demonstrated a strong correlation between resistivity anomalies and subsurface voids at four sites in Florida. Solution cavities below the water table are filled with a groundwater‐solute mixture which is characterized by a lower electrical resistivity than the enclosing country rock (Eocene and younger limestone). Air‐filled cavities above the water table exhibit markedly high‐resistivity anomalies. Confirmation drilling of postulated cavities and other anomalies suggests the method can be used with confidence for identification and location of highway‐threatening solution cavities with diameters as small as 3 to 5 m to a depth of 25 to 30 m.",10.1190/1.1442135
Interpretation Of Gravity Anomalies Due To Finite Inclined Dikes Using Fourier Transformation,"The Fourier transform of the gravity field due to a finite dipping dike is derived and its real and imaginary components are separated. Analysis of these two functions in a certain high‐frequency range yields simple relations that can be used to estimate the unknown parameters of the dike. The theoretical considerations are tested on synthetic data after performing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and the validity of the method of interpretation is established from a comparison of the actual and estimated parameters.",10.1190/1.1440713
Theoretical Seismograms With Frequency And Depth Dependent Absorption,"In the computation of conventional theoretical (or ""synthetic"") seismograms, the effects of the variation of frequency‐dependent absorption with depth are presently ignored. Such absorption can produce significant differences in both the relative amplitudes and frequency spectra of primary and multiple reflections having the same arrival time. This paper describes a feasible way, using a digital computer of the IBM 7090 class, for computing theoretical seismograms which properly take into account the variation of absorption with both frequency and depth, it being assumed that the absorption coefficient varies linearly with frequency. It is pointed out that attempts to solve the problem using Fourier analysis in the frequency domain would lead to significant aliasing errors. Consequently a method borrowed from the field of network theory utilizing deconvolution is devised whereby solutions are obtained directly in the time domain. Both ""primary"" and ""primary‐plus‐all‐multiple"" traces are computed, the former including the ""peg‐leg"" multiples described by Anstey (1960) and Webster (1960). These calculations demonstrate that absorption can reduce the multiple content of theoretical seismograms.",10.1190/1.1439098
Efficient Gravity Inversion Of Discontinuous Basement Relief,"We have developed a gravity inversion method to estimate a discontinuous basement relief based on an extended version of Bott's method that allows variable density contrasts between sediments and basement, optimizes the modulus of the solution correction at each iteration, and provides for solution stabilization. Initially, we obtain a linear approximation stabilized by the total variation functional that correctly maps the horizontal positions of the existing high-angle faults but produced poor estimates of the basin depths. Subsequent iterations update the depth estimates toward the correct values, at the same time preserving the correct fault horizontal positions. Additionally, we stabilize each solution correction by the smoothness constraint without inverting any matrix. The method was substantially more efficient than the nonlinear method, which solves a system of linear equations by the conjugate gradient method at each iteration. For 3000 parameters, it is almost four times faster than the conjugate gradient, and this ratio increased with the number of parameters.",10.1190/geo2014-0513.1
Anisotropy And Dispersion In Periodically Layered Media,"Elastic waves propagating in a periodically layered medium exhibit transverse isotropy, provided the wavelength is long compared to the spatial period of the layer sequence. The elastic constants of the long‐wave equivalent transversely isotropic medium can be calculated in several ways, all of which are based on the low‐frequency limit: one either determines from the outset the macroscopic (in average homogeneous) strain response of a representative block of the periodically layered medium to (in average homogeneous) stresses, or one determines the dispersion equation for such media and evaluates this equation for low frequencies. Both approaches yield the same replacement medium. The replacement of a layered medium by a homogeneous transversely isotropic medium is justified if all wavelengths are sufficiently long. High‐resolution techniques, the increasing use of shear waves, and attention to stratigraphic detail require a quantitative evaluation of what is sufficiently long, as well as a study of what happens for wavelengths between that limit and the limit of resolution. Such information can be obtained through a numerical evaluation of the general dispersion equation: one obtains the frequency as a function of the spatial wave vector k. The phase velocity is the v=ωk/(k⋅k) and the group velocity g=gradkω. In general, both dispersion and anisotropy are to be expected. This method has been applied to SH-waves in periodically layered media in general, and the dispersion equation has been evaluated numerically for two representative media. The most significant result is that the long‐wavelengths approach, i.e., a nondispersive transversely isotropic replacement medium, is strictly valid for wavelengths larger than three times the spatial period of layering. For small angles against the vertical, dispersion for shorter wavelength is significant. However, for directions making an angle of more than about 30 degrees with the vertical, dispersion sets in at much shorter wavelengths and is in general much more gentle.",10.1190/1.1441672
Moveout Analysis Of Wide-Azimuth Data In The Presence Of Lateral Velocity Variation,"Moveout analysis of wide-azimuth reflection data seldom takes into account lateral velocity variations on the scale of spreadlength. However, velocity lenses (such as channels and reefs) in the overburden can cause significant, laterally varying errors in the moveout parameters and distortions in data interpretation. Here, we present an analytic expression for the normal-moveout (NMO) ellipse in stratified media with lateral velocity variation. The contribution of lateral heterogeneity (LH) is controlled by the second derivatives of the interval vertical traveltime with respect to the horizontal coordinates, along with the depth and thickness of the LH layer. This equation provides a quick estimate of the influence of velocity lenses and can be used to substantially mitigate the lens-induced distortions in the effective and interval NMO ellipses. To account for velocity lenses in nonhyperbolic moveout inversion of wide-azimuth data, we propose a prestack correction algorithm that involves computation of the lens-induced traveltime distortion for each recorded trace. The overburden is assumed to be composed of horizontal layers (one of which contains the lens), but the target interval can be laterally heterogeneous with dipping or curved interfaces. Synthetic tests for horizontally layered models confirm that our algorithm accurately removes lens-related azimuthally varying traveltime shifts and errors in the moveout parameters. The developed methods should increase the robustness of seismic processing of wide-azimuth surveys, especially those acquired for fracture-characterization purposes.",10.1190/geo2011-0307.1
Zonation For 3D Aquifer Characterization Based On Joint Inversions Of Multimethod Crosshole Geophysical Data,"Predictive groundwater modeling requires accurate information about aquifer characteristics. Geophysical imaging is a powerful tool for delineating aquifer properties at an appropriate scale and resolution, but it suffers from problems of ambiguity. One way to overcome such limitations is to adopt a simultaneous multitechnique inversion strategy. We have developed a methodology for aquifer characterization based on structural joint inversion of multiple geophysical data sets followed by clustering to form zones and subsequent inversion for zonal parameters. Joint inversions based on cross-gradient structural constraints require less restrictive assumptions than, say, applying predefined petrophysical relationships and generally yield superior results. This approach has, for the first time, been applied to three geophysical data types in three dimensions. A classification scheme using maximum likelihood estimation is used to determine theparameters of a Gaussian mixture model that defines zonal geometries from joint-inversion tomograms. The resulting zones are used to estimate representative geophysical parameters of each zone, which are then used for field-scale petrophysical analysis. A synthetic study demonstrated how joint inversion of seismic and radar traveltimes and electrical resistance tomography (ERT) data greatly reduces misclassification of zones (down from 21.3% to 3.7%) and improves the accuracy of retrieved zonal parameters (from 1.8% to 0.3%) compared to individual inversions. We applied our scheme to a data set collected in northeastern Switzerland to delineate lithologic subunits within a gravel aquifer. The inversion models resolve three principal subhorizontal units along with some important 3D heterogeneity. Petrophysical analysis of the zonal parameters indicated approximately 30% variation in porosity within the gravel aquifer and an increasing fraction of finer sediments with depth.",10.1190/1.3496476
Exact Expression For The Effective Acoustics Of Patchy-Saturated Rocks,"Seismic effects of a partially gas-saturated subsurface have been known for many years. For example, patches of nonuniform saturation occur at the gas-oil and gas-water contacts in hydrocarbon reservoirs. Open-pore boundary conditions are applied to the quasi-static Biot equations of poroelasticity to derive an exact analytic expression of the effective bulk modulus for partially saturated media with spherical gas patches larger than the typical pore size. The pore fluid and the rock properties can have different values in the central sphere and in the surrounding region. An analytic solution prevents loss of accuracy from ill-conditioned equations as encountered in the numerical solution for certain input. For a sandstone saturated with gas and water, we found that the P-wave velocity and attenuation in conventional models differ as much as 15% from the exact solution at seismic frequencies. This makes the use of present exact theory necessary to describe patchy saturation, although (more realistic) complex patch shapes and distributions were not considered. We found that, despite earlier corrections, the White conventional model does not yield the correct low-frequency asymptote for the attenuation.",10.1190/1.3463430
Geoelectrical Fields In A Layered Earth With Arbitrary Anisotropy,"In many cases in geoelectrical exploration, the standard model of a layered isotropic half‐space is a good approximation to geophysical reality. But sometimes it is useful to extend this model to uniform anisotropic layers. For example, in regions with distinct dipping stratification, one will try to represent this conductivity variation in the form of dipping anisotropic layers. In this paper, the layered isotropic half‐space is extended to a half‐ space with general anisotropy such that to each layer is assigned a symmetrical (3 × 3) resistivity tensor. After formulating the general layered problem, the numerical implementation is treated. A very fast algorithm exists only if the resistivity tensor is rotationally symmetric around a vertical axis (transverse isotropy). In all other cases, one has to calculate a double integral with respect to the horizontal components of the wavenumber vector. Furthermore, we have also calculated the magnetic field. Whereas in the isotropic case this field does not contain any information about the resitivity distribution, in the case of arbitrary anisotropy it carries some information about the distribution of resistivity inside the earth. No correct results are obtained if one interprets data resulting from an anisotropic structure by an isotropic model.",10.1190/1.1444547
Migration Velocity Analysis: Theory And An Iterative Algorithm,"Imaging complex structures inside the earth requires reasonable velocities that can be provided by applying prestack depth migration to multichannel seismic data. Migration velocity analysis is based on the principle that the images in the migrated data will be distorted when an erroneous velocity is used, and the difference of the imaged depths (residual moveout) at a common image gather is a measure of the error in the velocity. The imaging equations that we derive from Snell's law describe a general, quantitative relationship between migration images and migration velocity. Based on the imaging equations, we analyze properties of common‐image gathers and derive analytical formulas to represent residual moveout in some cases. These formulas show what factors affect the sensitivity of velocity analysis, which is useful to assess errors involved in velocity estimates. In addition, we develop a simple‐iteration algorithm to correct the layer velocities from residual moveout. The algorithm presented here is applicable to a medium that consists of constant‐velocity layers separated by arbitrary smooth interfaces. Some computer implementations are presented for both synthetic data and physical‐tank data. They demonstrate the effectiveness of our velocity analysis approach.",10.1190/1.1443741
Ridge Regression Applied To The Inversion Of Two‐Dimensional Aeromagnetic Anomalies,"The methodology presented was developed for processing and mathematical interpretation of aeromagnetic data derived from two‐dimensional sources. The inversion is based on the ridge regression technique as extended in Marquardt (1963) to nonlinear problems. The mathematical formulation provides a statistical approach for study of the efficiency of the solution. A procedure for data preparation is presented which includes a critical evaluation of the digital data obtained during the aerosurvey, joining of flight segments into a single line, and regional‐residual separation for profile analysis to set up the initial model approximation. The forward model is analyzed using predictive diagnostics called sensitivity coefficients and parameter correlation matrix. The parameter confidence intervals take into account the measurements of the nonlinearity of the quadratic approximation to the object function. The initial approximation is determined by profile analysis and by the geologic information that defines the forward model and its constraints. The nonuniqueness of the solution results in an interpretation that can be refined as new geologic information is applied for additional model constraints. Synthetic models are used to test and study the convergence and statistical properties of the solution, and to show the ability of the method to resolve anomalies due to various sources. The procedure is also applied to data obtained from aerosurveys over an oil exploration area of the upper Amazon sedimentary basin of Brazil. The validity of the solution is discussed in terms of its compatibility with the geologic information and constraints, and in terms of the statistical properties of the model parameters used to explain the observed data.",10.1190/1.1442000
On The Construction And Efficiency Of Staggered Numerical Differentiators For The Wave Equation,"Finite‐difference (FD) techniques have established themselves as viable tools for the numerical modeling of wave propagation. The accuracy and the computational efficiency of numerical modeling can be enhanced by using high‐order spatial differential operators (Dablain,1986).",10.1190/1.1442763
Dispersive Body Waves—An Experimental Study,"Body‐wave dispersion is documented for a three‐dimensional case using the pulse propagation experiment in the Pierre Shale conducted by McDonal et al. (1958) and for a two‐dimensional case using ultrasonic pulse propagation in a Plexiglas plate. The magnitude of the dispersion for a five‐octave frequency band was only about two to three percent but easily observable by using Fourier‐analysis techniques. Body‐wave dispersion is shown to be predictable from the attenuation coefficient by following the causal transform technique of Futterman (1962). The principle of superposition is shown to be applicable for the prediction of the pulse anywhere in a medium if the complex propagation constant is known and if the pulse is known at one location. Pulse‐form prediction based on the attenuation coefficient alone is inadequate, while prediction based on attenuation and dispersion is in good agreement with observed results.",10.1190/1.1439620
Proposed Geological Institute Of America,"At the Annual Meeting of The American Association of Petroleum Geologists at Denver in April, 1942, Dr. Carey Croneis gave an address on ""Geology in War and Peace."" In this address Croneis "" … contended that the profession of Geology does not occupy as high a position in National esteem, and thus in fundamental national utility, as its potential importance warrants."" To correct this condition he made "" … several suggestions for the good of the science."" The first of these was—""Organize an American Geological Association to which each geologist, each person fundamentally interested in the subject may belong, regardless of the field of specialization, or prime professional application."" Three other suggestions were made, the last of which has a very close relationship to the first and is as follows—""Inaugurate and consistently maintain a unified, vigorous, and yet dignified public relations program.""",10.1190/1.1486531
Comparison Of The Krief And Critical Porosity Models For Prediction Of Porosity And Vp/Vs,"VP/VS relations are key to the determination of lithology from seismic or sonic log data, as well as for direct seismic identification of pore fluids using, for example, amplitude variation with offset (AVO) analysis. While there are a variety of published VP/VS relations and VS prediction techniques, most reduce to two simple elements: (1) for each lithology, establish empirical relations among VP, VS, and porosity for one reference fluid—usually water—and (2) use Gassmann's (1951) relations to map these to other pore fluid states. In this short note we point out similarities between the critical porosity models of Nur (1992) and Krief et al. (1990) for predicting VP/VS. Both are useful, primarily because they incorporate the above two robust elements. Although derived from different directions, they are nearly identical.",10.1190/1.1444403
Simultaneous Inversion Of The Background Velocity And The Perturbation In Full-Waveform Inversion,"The gradient of standard full-waveform inversion (FWI) attempts to map the residuals in the data to perturbations in the model. Such perturbations may include smooth background updates from the transmission components and high wavenumber updates from the reflection components. However, if we fix the reflection components using imaging, the gradient of what is referred to as reflected-waveform inversion (RWI) admits mainly transmission background-type updates. The drawback of existing RWI methods is that they lack an optimal image capable of producing reflections within the convex region of the optimization. Because the influence of velocity on the data was given mainly by its background (propagator) and perturbed (reflectivity) components, we have optimized both components simultaneously using a modified objective function. Specifically, we used an objective function that combined the data generated from a source using the background velocity, and that by the perturbed velocity through Born modeling, to fit the observed data. When the initial velocity was smooth, the data modeled from the source using the background velocity will mainly be reflection free, and most of the reflections were obtained from the image (perturbed velocity). As the background velocity becomes more accurate and can produce reflections, the role of the image will slowly diminish, and the update will be dominated by the standard FWI gradient to obtain high resolution. Because the objective function was quadratic with respect to the image, the inversion for the image was fast. To update the background velocity smoothly, we have combined different components of the gradient linearly through solving a small optimization problem. Application to the Marmousi model found that this method converged starting with a linearly increasing velocity, and with data free of frequencies below 4 Hz. Application to the 2014 Chevron Gulf of Mexico imaging challenge data set demonstrated the potential of the proposed method.",10.1190/geo2014-0365.1
Euler Deconvolution Of Gravity Tensor Gradient Data,"Tensor Euler deconvolution has been developed to help interpret gravity tensor gradient data in terms of 3-D subsurface geological structure. Two forms of Euler deconvolution have been used in this study: conventional Euler deconvolution using three gradients of the vertical component of the gravity vector and tensor Euler deconvolution using all tensor gradients. These methods have been tested on point, prism, and cylindrical mass models using line and gridded data forms. The methods were then applied to measured gravity tensor gradient data for the Eugene Island area of the Gulf of Mexico using gridded and ungridded data forms. The results from the model and measured data show significantly improved performance of the tensor Euler deconvolution method, which exploits all measured tensor gradients and hence provides additional constraints on the Euler solutions.",10.1190/1.1444745
Evaluation Of An Observational Method For Estimation Of Remanent Magnetization,"This paper evaluates an observational method proposed by Zietz and Andreasen (1967) for estimating the remanent magnetization of a body from aeromagnetic data. Their method uses the position and relative intensity of the maximum and minimum produced by the causative body to infer the declination δ and inclination i of the total magnetization vector of the body. A series of plots which summarize over 800 modeled fields is presented which illustrate the utility and limitations at main field inclinations of 0, 30, 60, 75, and 90 degrees. As a general rule, the method is relatively insensitive for the estimation of δ and i near the geomagnetic equator, but it becomes increasingly sensitive toward the geomagnetic poles. However, the sensitivity is a complicated function of both δ and i at any magnetic latitude. Examination of the applicability of this method indicates that under limited circumstances magnetization declination δ can be estimated, but due to the zero‐level ambiguity inclination of the magnetization i is indeterminate.",10.1190/1.1441660
Seismic Wave Studies Over A High‐Speed Surface Layer,"The propagation of compressional, shear, and surface waves was studied along a 3,200 ft profile at a location where a 95‐ft‐thick surface layer of Austin chalk, with a compressional velocity of about 9,900 ft/sec, overlies a 400‐ft section of Eagle Ford shale with a speed of about 6,500 ft/sec. Woodbine sand, with a velocity of about 9,900 ft/sec, underlies the shale. Refracted first arrivals transmitted through the high speed surface layer show an increase of frequency with distance from the shot. A refracted second arrival from the Woodbine decreases in frequency and, after correction for spreading, increases in relative amplitude with distance. This would indicate that the high‐speed surface layer acts as a high‐pass filter for energy transmitted horizontally and as a low‐pass filter for energy transmitted vertically through the layer. Shear waves transmitted through the Austin chalk are also observed. Surface waves consist of two groups of arrivals; a brief train of high‐frequency waves (greater than 20 cps) propagated almost entirely in the surface layer is followed by a short train of low frequency waves. Unlike surface waves in most other localities, the two groups show almost no dispersion. The characteristics of both kinds of waves are interpreted qualitatively in terms of the layering.",10.1190/1.1438227
Seismic Model Study Of Refractions From A Layer Of Finite Thickness,"Two dimensional model experiments on refractions from layers of finite thickness are described. Refractions can be unreliable for velocity and depth determinations when they occur with wavelengths which are large compared to the layer thickness. Discrepancies reported between refraction velocities and borehole velocities can be partially accounted for in this manner. Even simple two‐ and three‐layer models can show such effects as misleading second arrivals, echeloning of travel time curves, masked layers, and selective absorption in the overburden.",10.1190/1.1438009
An Invariant Representation For The Magnetic Transfer Function In Magnetotellurics,"The magnetic transfer function in the magnetotelluric (MT) method can be represented by two simple complex functions that possess special properties in 3-D environments. This representation is obtained by means of a complex rotation matrix applied to the field measurements. One of the resulting functions is invariant with respect to rotations of the coordinate system and is closely related to the traditional concept known as tipper. The magnitude and phase of this new representation are invariant in a 3-D earth and unambiguously reduce to the corresponding formulas for 2-D cases. With these properties, the proposed representation overcomes the existing limitations of the current definition of the tipper. In the second complex function, the traditional concepts of rotation angle and skew appear naturally in the function's real and imaginary parts, respectively. We test the new representation using the response of a 3-D model. The results are compared with those obtained using current definitions.",10.1190/1.1444646
Principles Of Digital Multichannel Filtering,"The transition from single‐channel to multichannel data processing systems requires substantial modifications of the simpler single‐channel model. While the response function of a single‐channel digital filter can be specified in terms of scalar‐valued weighting coefficients, the corresponding response function of a multichannel filter is more conveniently described by matrix‐valued weighting coefficients. Correlation coefficients, which are scalars in the single‐channel case, now become matrices. Multichannel sampled data are manipulated with greater ease by recourse to multichannel z‐transform theory. Exact inverse filters are calculable by a matrix inversion technique which is the counterpart to the computation of exact single‐channel inverse operators by polynomial division. The delay properties of the original filter govern the stability of its inverse. This inverse is expressible in the form of a two‐stage cascaded system, whose first stage is a single‐channel recursive filter. Optimum multichannel filtering systems result from a generalization of the single‐channel least squares error criterion. The corresponding correlation matrices are now functions of coefficients which are themselves matrices. The system of normal matrix‐valued equations that is obtained in this manner can be solved by means of Robinson's generalization of the Wiener‐Levinson algorithm. Inverse multichannel filters are designed by specifying the desired output to be an identity matrix rather than a unit spike; if this matrix occurs at zero lag, the least squares filter is minimum‐delay. Simple numerical examples serve to illustrate the design principles involved and to indicate the types of problems that can be attacked with multichannel least squares processors.",10.1190/1.1440130
"Geophysical History Of The Good Field, Borden County, Texas","The Good oil field, located in the southwestern part of Borden County, Texas, became a reef oil producer in April, 1949. The discovery well was drilled subsequent to a seismic program along a suspected reef trend. The discovery was made without benefit of reef reflections, and was based only on maps showing Permian draping. This technique offers interesting comparisons between seismic and subsurface data.",10.1190/1.1438050
Seismic Sequence Analysis And Attribute Extraction Using Quadratic Time‐Frequency Representations,"The variation of frequency content of a seismic trace with time carries information about the properties of the subsurface reflectivity sequence. As a result, analysis of the data in terms of the local frequency content can provide a worthwhile addition to the standard procedures that are used in seismo‐stratigraphic interpretation. The theory of quadratic time‐frequency representations provides a solid foundation for local frequency analysis of seismic data and seismic attribute extraction. Two applications of the quadratic time‐frequency representations are demonstrated: seismic sequence analysis and seismic attribute extraction. The joint time‐frequency representation of a seismic reflection pattern is often much more easily interpreted in terms of subsurface stratification than the time‐or frequency‐domain description alone. We show how the time‐frequency representation can be used to delineate seismic sequences on the basis of the time‐frequency characteristics of the signal. There exists a close relation between complex‐trace attribute analysis and quadratic time‐frequency representations. In the time‐frequency approach, the seismic attributes are characteristics of the local spectrum. Extraction of the attributes from the time‐frequency representation of the seismic trace leads to considerable improvement of the signal‐to‐noise ratio of the attributes. Furthermore, the classic set of seismic attributes of instantaneous amplitude, phase, and frequency can be easily extended with other parameters describing the local spectrum, such as instantaneous bandwidth, skewness, and kurtosis.",10.1190/1.1487136
Apparent-Magnetization Mapping Using Entropic Regularization,"A new apparent-magnetization mapping method on the horizontal plane combines minimization of first-order entropy with maximization of zeroth-order entropy of the estimated magnetization. The interpretation model is a grid of vertical, juxtaposed prisms in both horizontal directions. To estimate the magnetization of the prisms, assume that the top and bottom of the magnetic sources are horizontal. Minimization of the first-order entropy favors solutions with sharp borders, and the maximization of zeroth-order entropy prevents the tendency of the estimated source to become a single prism with large magnetization. Thus, a judicious combination of both constraints can lead to solutions characterized by regions with virtually constant magnetizations separated by sharp discontinuities. This is applied to synthetic data from simulated intrusive bodies in sediments that have horizontal tops. By comparing the results with those obtained with the common Tikhonov regularization (smoothness constraint) method, it is shown that both methods produce good and equivalent locations of the central positions of the sources. However, entropic regularization delineates the boundaries of the bodies with greater detail. Both the proposed and the smoothness constraints are applied to real anomaly data over a magnetic skarn in Butte Valley, Nevada, U.S.A. Entropic regularization produced an estimated magnetization distribution with sharper boundaries, smaller volume, and higher apparent magnetization as compared with results produced by incorporating the smoothness constraint.",10.1190/1.3358160
Depth Of Investigation Of Collinear Electrode Arrays Over Homogeneous Anisotropic Half‐Space In Direct Current Methods,"The definition of depth of investigation as suggested by Evjen (1938) [subsequently used by Roy and Apparao (1971) also for the study of depth of investigation of electrode arrays in direct current methods for homogeneous isotropic earth] has been used to study the depth of investigation of various collinear electrode arrays for a homogeneous anisotropic half‐space. It has been shown that some simple transformations are to be applied to the expressions of normalized depth of investigation characteristic (NDIC) of the same arrays over homogeneous isotropic earth to obtain normalized depth of investigation characteristic of various arrays placed over homogeneous anisotropic earth. The novelty of anisotropy is that the depth of investigation of collinear electrode arrays over homogeneous anisotropic half‐space bears an inverse relationship with the coefficient of anisotropy and also depends upon array length and dip of the plane of stratification. The effect of the coefficient of anisotropy is most pronounced for horizontally stratified anisotropic earth and is independent of it for vertically stratified anisotropic earth—entirely consistent with the concept of the "";paradox of anisotropy."" The depth of investigation of all the collinear arrays for inclined stratification lies somewhere between the values obtained for horizontal and vertical stratifications.",10.1190/1.1441214
Variation In P-Wave Modulus With Frequency And Water Saturation: Extension Of Dynamic-Equivalent-Medium Approach,"We have developed a new modeling approach for the complex-valued P-wave modulus of a rock saturated with two-phase fluid accounting for the variation with frequency and water saturation. Our method is based on the dynamic-equivalent-medium approach theory, which predicts P-wave modulus dispersion due to mesoscopic-scale wave-induced fluid flow (WIFF). Although the application of the original theory was limited to small fluctuation media, we have extended it to also be applicable for high-fluctuation media such as partially saturated rock. Our modification and extension consists of two components. The first is introducing a scaling by the rigorous bounds for P-wave velocity dispersion by mesoscopic-scale WIFF. The second is to develop a model representing the effective patch size of stiffer fluid that controls the location of the dispersion curve. We have found that the spatial correlation length of heterogeneity of saturated rock used in the original theory does not appropriately capture the effective heterogeneity scale responsible for mesoscale pressure diffusion. Its variation with saturation can be properly accounted for by the proposed patch-sized variation model. The comparison of the theoretical prediction with the published laboratory velocity and attenuation measurements suggests that our approach predicts the wave properties for high-fluctuation media with reasonable accuracy. The effect of mesoscopic-scale pressure diffusion is significant and the amount of velocity dispersion and attenuation is large in high-fluctuation media; therefore, our extension will improve quantitative characterization of, for example, a CO2-sequestrated reservoir either by P-wave velocity or attenuation.",10.1190/geo2015-0045.1
Syngenetic Magnetic Anomaly Sources: Three Examples,"Aeromagnetic anomalies encountered in three areas, two in the western United States and one in Central America, are shown to arise from magnetic sedimentary formations. These examples are selected from a larger number of similar areas surveyed by Applied Geophysics, Inc. in various places in the U.S. Midcontinent and Rocky Mountain regions. The first area discussed is the northwest corner of Nebraska where the Miocene Arikaree formation, comprised of magnetic airfall and windblown tuffs, causes anomalies in areas of incised topography. The second area is located in south central Utah, where the Upper Cretaceous Kaiparowits sandstones contain detrital magnetite that causes large anomalies in tilted structures and over incised topography. The third area treated covers over half of southern Belize in Central America, including much of the offshore portion. Here, the Toledo formation of Paleocene‐Eocene age contains a thick section of clastic detritus rich in lithic grains of volcanic rocks that produce magnetic highs over thrusted and folded anticlinal axes. These three examples of magnetic anomalies due to syngenetic magnetite in widely scattered areas and from different types of source materials bring into question the assumption of so‐called ""diagenetic magnetite"" (or other magnetic minerals) as a cause of magnetic anomalies in other petroleum basins. It is necessary in all cases to determine the magnetic source from surface or subsurface geology, as was done here, rather than making assumptions strictly from magnetic profiles or mathematical models.",10.1190/1.1443124
"Magnetic Forward Models Of Cement Oil Field, Oklahoma, Based On Rock Magnetic, Geochemical, And Petrologic Constraints","Magnetic forward models of the Cement oil field, Oklahoma, were generated to assess the possibility that ferrimagnetic pyrrhotite related to hydrocarbon seepage in the upper 1 km of Permian strata contributes to aeromagnetic anomalies at Cement. Six bodies having different magnetizations were constructed for the magnetic models, based on geology and on petrologic and geochemical results, supplemented by rock magnetic measurements of shallow‐core and outcrop samples. The column of rock through which hydrocarbons have passed is divided into three sulfide zones on the basis of pyrrhotite content, and the column is capped by a 30 m thick zone that contains ferric oxide minerals formed mainly from oxidized pyrite. Red beds unaffected by sulfidization, as well as a zone of rock depleted in hematite but lacking sulfide, surround sulfidic zones. The synthetic magnetic profiles are controlled mainly by pyrrhotite‐bearing strata at depths of 200–500 m. The magnetizations of these bodies are calculated from: (1) petrographic estimates of pyrrhotite content relative to pyrite; (2) content of sulfide sulfur determined from chemical analysis; and (3) values for the magnetic susceptibility of monoclinic pyrrhotite. Total magnetizations of the bodies of highest pyrrhotite content range from about 3×10-3 to 56×10-3A/m in the present field direction and yield magnetic anomalies (at 120 m altitude) having amplitudes of less than 1 nT to ∼6 to 7 nT, respectively. Such amplitudes are much lower than those (as high as 60 nT) reported from the original total‐field survey over the Cement field. Numerous assumptions were made in the generation of the models, and thus the results neither prove nor disprove the existence of aeromagnetic anomalies related to hydrocarbon seepage at Cement. Nevertheless, the results suggest that pyrrhotite, formed via hydrocarbon reactions and within a range of concentrations estimated at Cement, is capable of causing magnetic anomalies.",10.1190/1.1442842
"Geophysics, Geology And Oil Finding","As geophysics has matured in recent years, its important place as a tool in oil exploration has been generally recognized. The operation of the partnership between geologist and geophysicist is relatively straightforward in reflection seismograph exploration as the geophysical maps are similar to those with which geologists are familiar. In geophysical methods based on potential fields (gravity and magnetic) the relations to geology are not so direct and the possible ambiguities are much greater. Close cooperation of geophysicist and geologist in the evaluation of such surveys should produce particularly fruitful results. Some specific examples of both regional and local nature are illustrated and discussed.",10.1190/1.1437535
Modeling Magnetostratigraphy In A Borehole,"The magnetic field along a hole bored through a sequence of dipping layers with varying magnetization and planar interfaces is calculated. The emphasis is on recovering remanent magnetization polarity transitions for magnetostratigraphic applications (dating, correlations), although intensity of remanent magnetization can in itself be a useful rock property. Results are presented for various cases of geologic interest in the form of axial vertical profiles and section maps of the holes at varying distances from polarity reversal interfaces. The vertical profiles demonstrate a resolving power of about six times the hole radius; meaningful magnetostratigraphies can be expected for rocks with a magnetization larger than 10-3Am-1, for instruments with a sensitivity of 0.1 nT. In a number of natural occurrences, it may not be necessary to resort to progressive demagnetization to recover the polarity sequence. Depending on which magnetic field and magnetization component one looks at, the section maps display characteristic patterns, in which, for instance, the direction of magnetization and the dip of the layers interfere. These maps are discussed in some detail. They can be used as guidelines to build a multisensor vector magnetometer (downhole magnetostratigraphic tool), whose output should be coupled with measurement of magnetic susceptibility for reduction of induced magnetization and with output from a surface instrument in a differential operation mode to reduce transient magnetic variations.",10.1190/1.1442740
Restricted Model Domain Time Radon Transforms,"The coefficients that synthesize seismic data via the hyperbolic Radon transform (HRT) are estimated by solving a linear-inverse problem. In the classical HRT, the computational cost of the inverse problem is proportional to the size of the data and the number of Radon coefficients. We have developed a strategy that significantly speeds up the implementation of time-domain HRTs. For this purpose, we have defined a restricted model space of coefficients applying hard thresholding to an initial low-resolution Radon gather. Then, an iterative solver that operated on the restricted model space was used to estimate the group of coefficients that synthesized the data. The method is illustrated with synthetic data and tested with a marine data example.",10.1190/geo2016-0270.1
Self-Potential Anomalies Induced By Water Injection Into Hydrocarbon Reservoirs,"The injection of cold water into a hydrocarbon reservoir containing relatively warmer, more saline formation brine may generate self-potential anomalies as a result of electrokinetic, thermoelectric, and/or electrochemical effects. We have numerically assessed the relative contributions of these effects to the overall self-potential signal generated during oil production in a simple hydrocarbon reservoir model. Our aim was to determine if measurements of self-potential at a production well can be used to detect the movement of water toward the well. The coupling coefficients for the electrochemical and thermoelectric potentials are uncertain, so we considered four different models for them. We also investigated the effect of altering the salinities of the formation and injected brines. We found that the electrokinetic potential peaked at the location of the saturation front (reaching values of 0.2 mV even for the most saline brine considered). Moreover, the value at the production well increased as the front approached the well, exceeding the noise level (∼ 0.1 mV). Thermoelectric effects gave rise to larger potentials in the reservoir (∼10 mV), but values at the well were negligible     ( ≲ 0 . 1 mV )  until after water breakthrough because of the lag in the temperature front relative to the saturation front. Electrochemical potentials were smaller in magnitude than thermoelectric potentials in the reservoir but were measurable     (  0 . 1 mV )  at the well because the salinity front was closely associated with the saturation front. When the formation brine was less saline (∼1 mol/liter), electrokinetic effects dominated; at higher salinities (∼5 mol/liter), electrochemical effects were significant. We concluded that the measurement of self-potential signals in a production well may be used to monitor the movement of water in hydrocarbon reservoirs during production, but further research is required to understand the thermoelectric and electrochemical coupling coefficients in partially saturated porous media.",10.1190/1.3596010
Analyzing The Effectiveness Of Receiver Arrays For Multicomponent Seismic Exploration,"The prestack analysis shows that the two arrays effectively suppress coherent noise on both the vertical and radial geophone data and perform reasonably as spatial antialias filters. The poststack analysis reveals that, for both the P‐P and P‐S data, neither of the two arrays significantly improves the quality of the final seismic image over that obtained from point receiver data. For the P‐P data there are subtle differences between the final stacked sections, while for the P‐S data there is a significant deterioration in image quality from the application of the arrays. This P‐S image deterioration is attributed to significant variation of shear‐wave statics across the array. For this specific survey area and acquisition parameters, 3C receiver arrays are unnecessary for P‐P data and are detrimental to P‐S data.",10.1190/1.1527085
Seismic Waves Coupled To Sonic Booms,Air‐coupled seismic waves of low frequencies were excited by aircraft‐generated sonic booms and detected by a hydrophone at moderate depth and a geophone on the sea floor. The experiments were conducted on the continental shelf off New Jersey.,10.1190/1.1439055
Crossline Resistivity Tomography For The Delineation Of Anomalous Seepage Pathways In An Embankment Dam,"Crossline resistivity tomography was developed to find out anomalous seepage pathways in an embankment dam. By applying crossline tomography to the investigation of embankment dams, leakage pathways can be effectively located because the crossline tomogram presents resistivity distribution in the horizontal plane of an embankment dam. To test the effectiveness of crossline tomography, we applied it to data from an experiment designed to delineate anomalous seepage pathways in the embankment dam. The method yields relatively accurate geoelectric structure of the dam when applied to synthetic data. In the crossline resistivity tomogram, abrupt discontinuities of a low resistivity band corresponding to the core of the dam can be interpreted as leakage pathways. Application to real data obtained from an embankment dam in Korea yields the result which accurately depicts two anomalous seepage pathways. The identified pathways were consistent with low resistivity zones in the dipole-dipole resistivity section obtained on the crest of the dam. One pathway was confirmed by visual inspection of the dam, and afterward, by trenching.",10.1190/1.2435200
An Empirical Study Of Instability And Improvement Of Absorbing Boundary Conditions For The Elastic Wave Equation,"One of the persistent problems with numerical solutions to the elastic wave equation is the finite size of the numerical grid. As with a physical body, the grid boundaries will reflect incident energy. If not eliminated or reduced substantially, these reflections will invade the grid interior and interfere with the desired solution. One method for eliminating reflections is creating a large and/or expanding grid. This method may be impractical since it can be quite costly in both computer time and memory. Another method is making the grid boundary ""transparent"" to outgoing energy. This method is ideally done by designing absorbing or nonreflecting boundaries which are mathematically equivalent to a one‐way, or outgoing, elastic wave equation only. In practice, an outgoing elastic wave equation is an approximation since the wave equation is not generally separable into outgoing and incoming parts. Two absorbing boundary condition approximations commonly used are those from Reynolds (Reynolds, 1978) and Clayton and Engquist, (Clayton and Engquist, 1977).",10.1190/1.1442198
The Spectrographic Correlation Of Oil Well Waters,"A spectrographic analysis of oil well water brines is described, which allows the detection and measurement of a much larger number of elements than the chemical method usually employed, with a considerable saving of time. This larger number of correlation variables have been analyzed statistically and found to give correlations in many cases where the usual chemical tests were inadequate. It is proposed that the same methods may be applied to core analysis.",10.1190/1.1438072
A Curve-Fitting Technique For Determining Dispersion Characteristics Of Guided Elastic Waves,"We have developed a novel curve-fitting method to estimate dispersion characteristics of guided elastic waves and investigate its application to field wireline and logging while drilling (LWD) acoustic data processing. In an elastic waveguide such as a fluid-filled borehole with a logging tool, the frequency dispersion of a guided-wave mode is characterized by a monotonically varying dispersion curve bounded by its low- and high-frequency limits. The detailed behavior of the curves relates to various elastic/acoustic parameters of the complicated waveguide structure. The novelty of the proposed technique is that it simulates the multiparameter dispersion curve using a simple analytical function that has only four parameters. By adjusting the four parameters to fit the actual wave dispersion data, the wave's dispersion characteristics can be satisfactorily determined. The result of this simple approach leads to several important applications in acoustic logging. The first is to correct the dispersion effect in the shear-wave velocity from wireline dipole acoustic logging. The second application obtains P-wave velocity from the dispersive leaky compressional-wave data from wireline or LWD measurements. Third, the technique is applied to obtain shear-wave velocity from LWD quadrupole shear-wave logging. Finally, the technique is applicable to layered waveguide structures encountered in surface seismic exploration.",10.1190/1.3420736
Scattering By Hydraulic Fractures: Finite‐Difference Modeling And Laboratory Data,"Reservoir production can be stimulated by creating hydraulic fractures that effectively facilitate the inflow of hydrocarbons into a well. Considering the effectiveness and safety of the operation, it is desirable to monitor the size and location of the fracture. In this paper we investigate the possibilities of using seismic waves generated by active sources to characterize the fractures. First, we must understand the scattering of seismic waves by hydraulic fractures. For that purpose we use a finite‐difference modeling scheme. We argue that a mechanically open hydraulic fracture can be represented by a thin, fluid‐filled layer. The width or aperture of the fracture is often small compared to the seismic wavelength, which forces us to use a very fine grid spacing to define the fracture. Based on equidistant grids, this results in a large number of grid points and hence computationally expensive problems. We show that this problem can be overcome by allowing for a variation in grid spacing in the finite‐difference scheme to accommodate the large‐scale variation in such a model. Second, we show ultrasonic data of small‐scale hydraulic fracture experiments in the laboratory. At first sight it is difficult to unravel the interpretation of the various events measured. We use the results of the finite‐difference modeling to postulate various possible events that might be present in the data. By comparing the calculated arrival times of these events with the laboratory and finite‐difference data, we are able to propose a plausible explanation of the set of scattering events. Based on the laboratory data, we conclude that active seismic sources can potentially be used to determine fracture size and location in the field. The modeling example of fracture scattering illustrates the benefit of the finite‐difference technique with a variation in grid spacing for comparing numerical and physical experiments.",10.1190/1.1444757
Identification Of Shallow-Water-Flow Sands By Vp/Vs Inversion Of Conventional 3D Seismic Data," Shallow-water flow (SWF) from overpressured, unconsolidated/uncemented sands is a high-profile hazard in deep-water drilling. Thus, accurate predrill seismic prediction of SWF sands is an important practical problem. Laboratory measurements show high seismic compressional-to-shear velocity (Vp/Vs) ratios in SWF sands. Thus, Vp/Vs anomalies produced by elastic seismic inversion can provide a quantitative identification of SWF sands before drilling. Three 3D common-angle-aperture prestack time-migrated data sets from the Garden Banks area of the Gulf of Mexico are inverted simultaneously for Vp/Vs. Two wells provide constraints. High Vp/Vs values are observed in a known SWF zone in Shell Deepwater Development's well GB920 #1. In Kerr-McGee Oil  Gas Corporation's well GB877 #1, Vp/Vs anomalies match well with independent predrill SWF sand predictions based on geologic information and seismic amplitudes. High Vp/Vs anomalies (9) are used to identify potential SWF sands away from the wells. We conclude that Vp/Vs values are more diagnostic than seismic amplitudes alone for SWF sand detection, and that low S-impedance is the most salient indicator of SWF potential. Raw elastic seismic-amplitude variation with angle data provide unreliable indicators in cases where SWF sands are thin (where interference occurs between reflections from the layer tops and bottoms) or if viscoelasticity is significant.",10.1190/1.2052470
How To Evaluate Exploration Prospects,"Analytical evaluations raise petroleum exploration from the realm of educated guessing to a quantitative decision level that is compatible with modern business techniques. Management and explorationists can thus appraise the merits of an area and/or exploration program and expect to derive optimum results with a minimum risk. All petroleum exploration programs have one common goal: To find and exploit reserves of oil and gas at a profit. Today the economic factors are playing a dominant role in the highly competitive world petroleum situation. In order to justify his existence in the forecast 70‐billion‐dollar exploration effort during the next ten years, the scientist must translate his thoughts into terms the nontechnical business man or executive can readily grasp. The obvious common language is dollars and cents in terms of anticipated profits. These economic terms transcend the semantics barrier that normally exists between the executive and the oil finder. Various methods are discussed to show how geophysicists and geologist can convert exploration factors into anticipated profit‐to‐risk ratios. The authors include examples. Significant factors contributing to a successful exploration program are: (1) The exploration and economic analysis must be compatible with, and integrated into, modern business techniques. That is, the analysis must enhance the executive's ability to make decisions. (2) The explorationist must recognize and avoid ""marginal ventures,"" because 60 percent of the wells completed in the United States are submarginal economically. (3) The laws of probability must be taken into consideration when establishing an exploration program. (4) To insure success, a company must hold risks to a minimum. This can be accomplished, in part, by participating in a large number of potentially profitable ventures, and/or by taking only a part of each drilling venture rather than the entire deal. (5) Anticipated profit‐to‐risk cost ratios can be estimated for many areas. Oil companies can use this information in evaluating and accepting wildcat prospects that have at least double the normal odds of developing into a profitable oil field. The scientist who applies quantitative analyses skillfully will quickly achieve both recognition within his company and the status of a key decision‐maker in his company's exploration program.",10.1190/1.1439378
Interpolation And Gridding Of Aliased Geophysical Data Using Constrained Anisotropic Diffusion To Enhance Trends,"Geophysical data are frequently collected with a fine sample interval along traverse lines but with a coarser sampling in the direction perpendicular to the traverses. This disparity in sampling intervals is particularly evident when magnetic data are collected simultaneously with airborne electromagnetic data. Interpolating this traverse data onto an evenly spaced 2D grid can result in aliasing artifacts. For example, narrow linear structures that trend at acute angles to the traverse lines are imaged as a thick/thin/thick feature, looking like a boudinage or string of beads. Applying the anisotropic diffusion process to the resulting grids of data removes the artifacts, but the grid values close to the traverses are altered significantly from their initial values. The altered values are therefore not faithful to the original traverse data. The anisotropic diffusion algorithm can be modified to constrain values close to the original traverses. This modification removes the aliasing artifacts and produces a data grid faithful to the original traverse data. Some small artifacts along the traverse lines in the final data grid become more evident when grids containing derivative data (such as the analytic signal) are generated from the new data grid. However, these small traverse-line artifacts can be removed with standard microleveling procedures. The constrained anisotropic diffusion process is iterative, and some experimentation is required to determine the appropriate number of iterations. ",10.1190/1.2080759
Electromagnetic Sounding With Susceptibility Among The Model Parameters,"The response of electromagnetic sounding systems is insensitive to the ordinary variations in magnetic susceptibility. However, in layered earth models susceptibilities of more than 0.005 may affect the system response appreciably, and susceptibility values of this magnitude might be determined by model fitting to parametric sounding observations. Electromagnetic soundings might, therefore, be used to reveal the existence of remanent magnetization in some cases. These conclusions are drawn from numerical studies with theoretical models.",10.1190/1.1440717
Effect Of Cementation On Ultrasonic Velocities In Sandstones,"We determine the acoustic velocities for samples cored from the Jauf and Unayzah sandstone formations of Saudi Arabia. We use microstructural analysis including thin sections and point counting to quantify cementation. Velocities in these formations are strongly controlled by the combination of porosity and cementation. Consequently, rocks of similar porosity but with different cementation materials display different velocities. The objective of this study is to understand the effect of cementation on the acoustic velocity. Cements in these two formations have variable compositions and properties. Pure quartz overgrowth plays a major role in increasing velocities while clay and clay coatings play a minor role. We found that clay coatings inhibit the quartz overgrowth cement leading to a decrease in velocities. Understanding the influence of various cementation types on velocity, and thus elastic properties in sandstone cores, enables an understanding of the variation of sonic velocities and moduli across these formations. The uniqueness of this study is that we emphasize the quantification of the role of cement and not just mineral volume.",10.1190/1.2431327
Anisotropy Effects In P-Wave And Sh-Wave Stacking Velocities Contain Information On Lithology,"Depths calculated from S-wave stacking velocities and event times almost always exceed actual depths, sometimes by as much as 25 percent. In contrast, depths from corresponding P-wave information are often within 10 percent of actual depths. Discrepancies in depths calculated from P- and S-wave data are attributed to velocity anisotropy, a property of sedimentary rocks that noticeably affects S-wave moveout curves but leaves the P-wave relatively unaffected. Two careful studies show that discrepancies in depths, and hence in constituent layer thicknesses, correlate with lithology. Discrepancies ranged from an average of 13 percent (Midland basin) to greater than 40 percent (Paloma field) in shales, but were within expected errors in massive sandstones or carbonates. Hence anisotropy effects are indicators of lithology. Analysis of seismic data involved determining interval velocities from stacking velocities, calculating layer thicknesses, and then comparing layer thicknesses from S-wave data with thicknesses from P-wave data. When the S-wave thicknesses were significantly greater than the P-wave (i.e., outside the range of expected errors), I concluded the layer was anisotropic. I illustrate the technique with data from the Paloma field project of the Conoco Shear Wave Group Shoot.",10.1190/1.1442119
Estimating Anisotropy Parameters And Traveltimes In The Τ‐P Domain,"Since inversion for anisotropic parameters is very nonunique, we develop expressions requiring only a reduced number of parameters. Nevertheless, predictions using these expressions are more accurate than Taylor series expansions and are also able to handle cusps in the SV traveltime curves. In addition, layer stripping is a linear process. Therefore, both effective (average) and local (interval) estimates can be obtained.",10.1190/1.1500368
A Photoelastic Study Of Stress Wave Propagation In A Quarter‐Plane,"An experimental investigation was conducted on a quarter‐plane loaded with an explosive charge at one point on the boundary. Experimental methods of dynamic photoelasticity and interferometry were used to obtain full‐field data of the dynamic event. Results of the study were obtained for both the P and R‐wave interaction with the corner. Energy reflection coefficients were found for the P‐wave interaction. For the Rayleigh wave, where the response was more significant, transmission and reflection coefficients based on both stress and surface energy were established. Subsurface stress distributions for the transmitted and reflected Rayleigh waves were obtained in the region near the corner.",10.1190/1.1440170
Seismic Attenuation Of Atlantic Margin Basalts: Observations And Modeling,"Paleogene basalts are present over much of the northeastern Atlantic European margin. In regions containing significant thicknesses of layered basalt flows, conducting seismic imaging within and beneath the volcanic section has proven difficult, largely because the basalts severely attenuate and scatter seismic energy. We use data from a vertical seismic profile (VSP) from well 164/07-1 that penetrated   1.2 km   of basalt in the northern Rockall Trough west of Britain to measure the seismic attenuation caused by the in-situ basalts. The effective quality factor  Qeff  of the basalt layer is found from the VSP to be 15–35, which is considerably lower (more attenuative) than the intrinsic attenuation measured on basalt samples in the laboratory. We then run synthetic seismogram models to investigate the likely cause of the attenuation. Full waveform 1D modeling of stacked sequences of lava flows based on rock properties from the same well indicates that much of the seismic attenuation observed from the VSP can be accounted for by the scattering effects of multiple thin layers with high impedance contrasts. Phase-screen seismic modeling of the rugose basalt surface at the top-of-basalt sediment interface, with the magnitude and wavelength of the relief constrained by a 3D seismic survey around the well, suggests that surface scattering from this interface plays a much smaller role than internal scattering in attenuating the seismic signal as it passes through the basalt sequence.",10.1190/1.2335875
"Magnetic, Electrical, And Gpr Waterborne Surveys Of Moraine Deposits Beneath A Lake: A Case History From Turin, Italy","Bathymetry and bottom sediment types of inland water basins provide meaningful information to estimate water reserves and possible connections between surface and groundwater. Waterborne geophysical surveys can be used to obtain several independent physical parameters to study the sediments. We explored the possibilities of retrieving information on both shallow and deep geological structures beneath a morainic lake by means of waterborne nonseismic methods. In this respect, we discuss simultaneous magnetic, electrical, and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) waterborne surveys on the Candia morainic lake in northerly Turin (Italy). We used waterborne GPR to obtain information on the bottom sediment and the bathymetry needed to constrain the magnetic and electrical inversions. We obtained a map of the total magnetic field (TMF) over the lake from which we computed a 2D constrained compact magnetic inversion for selected profiles, along with a laterally constrained inversion for one electrical profile. The magnetic survey detected some deep anomalous bodies within the subbottom moraine. The electrical profiles gave information on the more superficial layer of bottom sediments. We identify where the coarse morainic material outcrops from the bottom finer sediments from a correspondence between high GPR reflectivity, resistivity, and magnetic anomalies.",10.1190/geo2011-0053.1
Decoupled Equations For Reverse Time Migration In Tilted Transversely Isotropic Media,"Conventional modeling and migration for tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) media may suffer from numerical instabilities and shear wave artifacts due to the coupling of the P-wave and SV-wave modes in the TTI coupled equations. Starting with the separated P- and SV-phase velocity expressions for vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) media, we extend these decoupled equations for modeling and reverse time migration (RTM) in acoustic TTI media. Compared with the TTI coupled equations published in the geophysical literature, the new TTI decoupled equations provide a more stable solution due to the complete separation of the P-wave and SV-wave modes. The pseudospectral method is the most convenient method to implement these equations due to the form of wavenumber expressions and has the added benefit of being highly accurate and thus avoiding numerical dispersion. The rapid expansion method (REM) in time is employed to produce a broad band numerically stable time evolution of the wavefields. Synthetic results validate the proposed TTI decoupled equations and show that modeling and RTM in TTI media with the decoupled equations remain numerically stable even for models with strong anisotropy and sharp contrasts.",10.1190/geo2011-0175.1
The Inverse Correlations Between Methane Content And Elastic Parameters Of Coal-Bed Methane Reservoirs,"We investigated three coal-bed methane (CBM) reservoirs in which there exist, when we are careful about data quality and reduce environmental variations, inverse correlations between methane content and the elastic properties of the coal beds. Such inverse correlations may exist in general in high- and medium-rank CBM reservoirs. There is evidence that supports the generalization of such inverse correlations and factors that distort them. These distorting factors may prevent identification of such inverse correlations in certain CBM prospects; however, they cannot negate the underlying inverse correlations. Such inverse correlations may play a role in CBM amplitude versus offset (AVO) similar to the role played by Gassmann-Biot theory (Gassmann, 1951; Biot, 1956, 1962) in AVO technology for conventional gas reservoirs. This may lay the first brick for a theoretical basis of CBM AVO.",10.1190/geo2012-0352.1
A Versatile Algorithm For Joint 3D Inversion Of Gravity And Magnetic Data,"We describe the implementation of a versatile method for interpreting gravity and magnetic data in terms of 3D structures. The algorithm combines a number of features that have proven useful in other algorithms. To accommodate structures of arbitrary geometry, we define the subsurface using a large number of prisms, with the depths to the tops and bottoms as unknowns to be determined by optimization. Included in the optimization process are the three components of the magnetization vector and the density contrast, which is assumed to be a continuous function with depth. We use polynomial variations of the density contrast to simulate the natural increase of rock density with depth in deep sedimentary basins. The algorithm minimizes the quadratic norm of residuals combined with a regularization term. This term controls the roughness of the upper and lower topographies defined by the prisms. This results in simple shapes by penalizing the norms of the first and second horizontal derivatives of the prism depths and bottoms. Finally, with the use of quadratic programming, it is a simple matter to include a priori information about the model in the form of equality or inequality constraints. The method is first tested using a hypothetical model, and then it is used to estimate the geometry of the Ensenada basin by means of joint inversion of land and offshore gravity and land, offshore, and airborne magnetic data. The inversion helps constrain the structure of the basin and helps extend the interpretation of known surface faults to the offshore.",10.1190/1.1581067
On The Field Due To A Vertical Line Source Of Current Grounded To Earth,"An expression for the current density at any point in the earth due to a current in an infinitely long vertical wire is found for two types of current: (1) Simply periodic, (2) Rectangular impulse. These are given respectively by equations (11) and (13) below, where Ir is the horizontal radial component and Iz the vertical component of the current density vector at the point (r, z), which is at a distance R from the grounding point. These formulas hold for frequencies not too high or times not too small to allow neglect of the displacement current.",10.1190/1.1439469
Nonlinear Impedance Of Mineral‐Electrolyte Interfaces: Part I. Pyrite,"The impedance of the interface between an acidic electrolyte and polished electrodes of pyrite has been investigated at current densities in the nonlinear range (up to 5mA/cm2). The potential across a single interface relative to a reference electrode was measured in response to a current sinusoid of low frequency (0.002 Hz). Polarization curves, or linear plots of current density versus electrode potential, consisted of distorted Lissajous patterns. At peak current densities the interface impedance is low and is dominated by activation controlled reactions involving pyrite dissolution and hydrogen gas evolution. The polarization curves have a series of step‐like features at intermediate potentials due to current‐limited reactions. These secondary reactions involve solid and/or aqueous reaction products from previous reactions. The high impedance portion of each reaction step corresponds to a limit current caused by either depletion of a particular solid reactant or employment of a current larger than can be carried by diffusion of aqueous reactants. Nonlinear behavior of pyrite was found to be independent of carrier type and conductivity. The potential of the anodic pyrite dissolution reaction was weakly dependent on pH. Potentials of cathodic reactions increased with increasing pH, indicating the involvement of H+, as demonstrated by the evolution of hydrogen gas and H2S gas.",10.1190/1.1440889
Magnetic Gradients Produced By A 2D Homogeneous Polygonal Source,"We use a set of analytic equations for calculating horizontal and vertical gradients of the magnetic anomaly produced by a 2D homogeneous magnetic source with a polygonal cross section. The magnetization vector of the source is assumed to be constant and known, and the anomalous field is assumed to be much smaller than the ambient geomagnetic field in magnitude. The derivation begins from an expression of the magnetic potential; then we evaluate clockwise integrations to establish the equations. A comparison between this analytic approach and a numerical approach using the finite-difference method to compute gradients indicates the reliability of the equations. The proposed method is numerically efficient and does not present singularity on the edges of the polygon prism, except at the vertices where the gradients approach to infinity.",10.1190/1.3008054
"Geothermal Surveys In Sedimentary Rocks Near Grants And Laguna, New Mexico","Data obtained from temperature surveys in drill holes over two uranium ore bodies are presented as maps of isotherms at depths of 100 ft or more. Temperature surveys in permeable ore bodies above the water table may reveal zones of downward migration of oxygenated water, or zones with a comparatively large retention of pore water. These zones may be associated with an increased amount of oxidation in an ore body which is not completely oxidized.",10.1190/1.1439590
Linearized Inversion Of Multioffset Seismic Reflection Data In The Ω-K Domain: Depth‐Dependent Reference Medium,"The computation of synthetic seismograms can be linearized with respect to a reference medium that issno close to the actual medium. Using a least‐squares formulation, the inverse problem can then be set up as a problem of quadratic optimization. The inverse problem is greatly simplified if the reference medium is symmetric. For a homogeneous reference medium, a rigorous and economic solution can be obtained by Fourier transforming all spatial variables. In particular, the solution can be obtained through an explicit formula that does not require the resolution of any linear system (as is the case when not working in the Fourier domain). However, the assumption of a homogeneous reference medium is generally not realistic. In some situations, the reference medium can be depth‐dependent. It can then be shown that by Fourier transforming time and all spatial variables except depth, the inverse problem also has an elegant and economic solution. If δm(x,z) is the (unknown) difference between the reference medium and the true (2-D) medium, the Fourier‐transformed solution δm(kx,z) can be obtained by solving, for each value of the horizontal wavenumber kx, a linear system whose dimension equals the number of depth samples.",10.1190/1.1442399
"Targeting Nickel Sulfide Deposits From 3D Seismicreflection Data At Kambalda, Australia","The greenstone belts of the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, host numerous Archaean gold, nickel, and iron ore deposits. These deposits typically are found in complex geologic structures hidden by a deep, heterogeneous, and often conductive regolith profile. This added complexity limits the depth of penetration for the potential field methods, but at the same time opens new revenue possibilities through the application of seismic methods. To explore this opportunity, we acquired high-resolution, experimental, 3D seismic data over Lake Lefroy in Kambalda, Western Australia. The main objective was to map exceptionally complex, deep structures associated with Kambalda dome. Survey design used 3D ray tracing to improve the distribution of the common reflection points across ultramafic-basalt contacts which host numerous small, high-grade nickel sulfide deposits. A combination of small explosive sources, high-shot/receiver density, and exceptionally good coupling over the ultrasalty lake surface produced seismic data of very high quality. Processing focused on computation of accurate static and dynamic corrections, whereas imaging was helped by the existing geologic model. Advanced volumetric interpretation supported by seismic forward modeling was used to guide mapping of the main lithological interfaces and structures. Forward modeling was carried out using rock properties obtained from ultrasonic measurements and one borehole, drilled in the proximity of the 3D seismic volume. Using this information, geometric constraints based on the typical size of ore bodies found in this mine and a simple window-based seismic attribute, several new targets were proposed. Three of these targets subsequently have been drilled and new zones of mineralization were intercepted. The case study presented demonstrates that high-quality, high-resolution, 3D seismic data combined with volumetric seismic interpretation could become a primary methodology for exploration of deep, small, massive sulfide deposits distributed across the Kambalda area.",10.1190/geo2011-0514.1
Autocorrelogram Migration: Theory,"We present the equations for migrating inverse‐vertical‐seismic‐profile‐while‐drilling and common‐midpoint autocorrelograms. These equations partly generalize the 1D autocorrelation imaging methods of Katz and Claerbout to 2D and 3D media, and also provide a formal mathematical procedure for imaging the reflectivity distribution from autocorrelograms. The imaging conditions are designed to migrate specific events in the autocorrelograms, either the direct‐primary correlations or the direct‐ghost correlations. Here, direct stands for direct wave, primary stands for primary reflections, and ghost denotes free‐surface ghost reflections. The main advantage in migrating autocorrelograms is that the source wavelet does not need to be known, which is the case for seismic data generated by a rotating drill bit or for vibroseis data with a corrupted pilot signal. Another advantage is that the source and receiver static problems are mitigated by autocorrelation migration. Two limitations are that autocorrelation of traces amplifies coherent noise such as surface waves, and produces undesirable coherent noise denoted as ""virtual multiples."" Similar to ""physical multiples,"" such noise can, in principle, be partially suppressed by filtering and stacking of migration images obtained from many different shot gathers. Results with both synthetic and field data validate this conjecture, and show that autocorrelogram migration can be a viable alternative to standard migration when the source signal is not adequately known or there are severe static problems.",10.1190/1.1620642
Atmospheric Potential Gradient Measurements,Relative atmospheric potential gradient measurements were made in the neighborhood of a salt dome. Two sets of measurements were made simultaneously at two different points. Wulf‐type electrometers were used with thorium ionium nitrate collectors insulated with sulphur. A number of set‐ups were made and no significant variations in potential gradient were found.,10.1190/1.1438076
Diffraction Traveltime Approximation For General Anisotropic Media,"Diffractions play an important role in seismic processing because they can be used for high-resolution imaging and the analysis of subsurface properties like the velocity distribution. Until now, however, only isotropic media have been considered in diffraction imaging. We have developed a method wherein we derive an approximation for the diffraction response for a general 2D anisotropic medium. Our traveltime expression is formulated as a double-square-root equation that allows us to accurately and reliably describe diffraction traveltimes. The diffraction response depends on the ray velocity, which varies with angle and thus offset. To eliminate the angle dependency, we expand the ray velocity in a Taylor series around a reference ray. We choose the fastest ray of the diffraction response, i.e., the ray corresponding to the diffraction apex as the reference ray. Moreover, in an anisotropic medium, the location of the diffraction apex may be shifted with respect to the surface projection of the diffractor location. To properly approximate the diffraction response, we consider this shift. The proposed approximation depends on four independent parameters: the emergence angle of the fastest ray, the ray velocity along this ray, and the first- and second-order derivatives of the ray velocity with respect to the ray angle. These attributes can be determined from the data by a coherence analysis. For the special case of homogeneous media with polar anisotropy, we establish relations between anisotropy parameters and the parameters of the diffraction operator. Therefore, the stacking attributes of the new diffraction operator are suitable to determine anisotropy parameters from the data. Moreover, because diffractions provide a better illumination than reflections, they are particularly suited to analyze seismic anisotropy at the near offsets.",10.1190/geo2012-0346.1
Direct Determination Of The Natural Remanent Magnetization Effect In A Hole Drilled In Layered Ground From Magnetic Field And Susceptibility Logs,"A new method as presented, allows the joint interpretation of both electromagnetic (EM) and magnetic logs in layered ground, based on the fact that the susceptibility responses for these two measurements are linear. Thus we can make use of the classical properties of the Fourier transform to extract from these two signals the magnetic field due to remanent magnetization. Theoretical models show that for a sufficient sample step this remanent magnetization can be recovered, even if the Koenigsberger ratio is of the order of 0.2 and if the thickness of the magnetized layer is of the order of 1 m. The results for two case examples in a sedimentary context are also shown. Despite the difficulties due to experimental procedures, we show that the amplitude of the extracted information is significant in these two cases, even if its variations are somewhat structureless and cannot be easily explained by the geology.",10.1190/1.1443300
Velocity And Density Profiles Of A Layered Acoustic Medium From Common Source‐Point Data,"An inverse scattering theory is presented for the unique reconstruction of the density and velocity profiles of a layered acoustic half‐space from common source‐point surface data. The point source is either impulsive or is capable of vibrating at two arbitrary frequencies. An additional datum for the unique reconstruction of these profiles is an estimate of either the highest or lowest velocity within the inhomogeneous acoustic half‐space. Two direct (noniterative) inversion algorithms are developed which construct the density and velocity profiles of the inhomogeneous half‐space from these data. Analytical examples are presented in which all steps in the inversion algorithms are analytically determined. Finally, the paper discusses the potential application of the theory to real seismic data.",10.1190/1.1441356

Continuous Active-Source Seismic Monitoring Of C O2 Injection In A Brine Aquifer,"Continuous crosswell seismic monitoring of a small-scale   C O2    injection was accomplished with the development of a novel tubing-deployed piezoelectric borehole source. This piezotube source was deployed on the   C O2    injection tubing, near the top of the saline aquifer reservoir at   1657-m   depth, and allowed acquisition of crosswell recordings at   15-minute   intervals during the multiday injection. The change in traveltime recorded at various depths in a nearby observation well allowed hour-by-hour monitoring of the growing   C O2    plume via the induced seismic velocity change. Traveltime changes of   0.2 to 1.0 ms   (up to 8%) were observed, with no change seen at control sensors placed above the reservoir. The traveltime measurements indicate that the   C O2    plume reached the top of the reservoir sand before reaching the observation well, where regular fluid sampling was occuring during the injection, thus providing information about the in situ buoyancy of   C O2   .",10.1190/1.2754716
A Borehole‐To‐Surface Electromagnetic Survey,"The results of a limited field trial confirm the usefulness of borehole‐to‐surface electromagnetic (EM) measurements for monitoring fluid extraction. A vertical EM profiling experiment was done at the University of California Richmond Field Station, where we simulated a brine spill plume by creating a saline water injection zone at the depth of 30 m. The data acquisition mode was analogous to the reverse vertical seismic profiling (VSP) configuration used for seismic measurements in that the EM transmitter traversed the PVC-cased borehole used for fluid injection and extraction while the receivers were deployed on the surface. The EM measurements were made at 9.6 kHz with an accuracy of 1% in signal amplitude and 1° in signal phase. Observations were taken at 5-m intervals along two intersecting profiles that were centered on the injection well and extended for 60 m on either side of it. The presence of the injected salt water, at the expected 30 m depth, was indicated clearly by differences between the pre‐extraction and postextraction data. A limited amount of numerical modeling showed that the experimental data were consistent with the presence of two superposed saline plumes. The uppermost of these, located at 26 m depth, was 2 m thick and had an area of 30 m2. The lower plume, located at 30 m, is the major cause of the observed anomaly, as it has an areal extent of 120 m2 and a thickness of 3 m. Surprisingly, the measurements were very sensitive to the presence of the cultural surficial conductivity anomalies. These spurious effects were reduced by spatial filtering of the data prior to interpretation.",10.1190/1.1444453
Adaptive Learning 3D Gravity Inversion For Salt-Body Imaging,"We have developed an iterative scheme for inverting gravity data produced by salt bodies with density contrasts relative to the sediments varying from positive to negative, crossing, in this way, the nil zone. Our inversion method estimates a 3D density-contrast distribution, through a piecewise constant function defined on a user-specified grid of cells. It consists of two nested iterative loops. The outer loop uses an adaptive learning strategy that starts with a coarse grid of cells, a set of first-guess geometric elements (axes and points) and the corresponding assigned density contrasts. From the second iteration on, this strategy refines the grid and automatically creates a new set of geometric elements (points only) and associated density contrasts. Each geometric element operates as the first-guess skeletal outline of a section of the salt body to be imaged. The inner loop estimates the 3D density-contrast distribution for the grid of cells and for the set of geometric elements defined in the outer loop. The outer loop allows for easy incorporation of prior geologic information about the lithologic units and automatic evolution of the prior information. The inner loop forces the estimated density contrast of each cell to be close either to a null or to a non-null prespecified value. The iteration stops when the geometries of the estimated salt bodies are invariant along successive iterations. We apply our method to synthetic gravity data produced by a homogeneous salt body embedded in heterogeneous sediments. We tested two geologic hypotheses about the real gravity data from Galveston Island salt dome, USA. In the first, the estimated salt body attains a maximum bottom depth of 5 km, whereas in the second hypothesis, it is shallower and discloses an overhang. Both solutions fit the data and are feasible geologically, so both hypotheses are acceptable.",10.1190/1.3555078
Improved Estimation Of Mineral And Fluid Volumetric Concentrations In Thinly Bedded Carbonate Formations,"We recently introduced new petrophysical and compositional methods for joint interpretation of multiple conventional well logs. These inversion-based methods are suited for petrophysical interpretation of rock formations that exhibit complex solid composition, include thin beds, and are subject to mud-filtrate invasion. They combine nuclear and resistivity logs to assess porosity and volumetric/weight concentrations of mineral and fluid constituents, and are ideal for the quantitative interpretation of carbonate formations. We document the successful application of the newly introduced inversion-based interpretation methods to three carbonate formations. Interpretation results are compared to those obtained with commercial software and core/X-ray diffraction (XRD) data whenever available. For two of the carbonate field examples where XRD data are available, nonlinear joint inversion of well logs improves the assessment of porosity by more than 30% and up to 100% in the presence of thin beds when compared to conventional interpretation methods.",10.1190/geo2012-0438.1
Determination Of Bouguer Density In Shallow Holes,"Inherent uncertainties of conventionally determined Bouguer‐density values may seriously affect the more sophisticated interpretation of gravity field results, predominantly in areas of irregular surface lithology. To minimize the consequences of such ""incorrect"" density values geophysicists have introduced and suggested corrective procedures (Nettleton, 1939; Vajk, 1956; Grant and El Saharty, 1962; Thyssen‐Bornemisza and Stackler, 1962; Hammer, 1963).",10.1190/1.1439380
Field Tests Of Electroseismic Hydrocarbon Detection,"Geophysicists, looking for new exploration tools, have studied the coupling between seismic and electromagnetic waves in the near-surface since the 1930s. Our research explores the possibility that electromagnetic-to-seismic (ES) conversion is useful at greater depths. Field tests of ES conversion over gas sands and carbonate oil reservoirs succeeded in delineating known hydrocarbon accumulations from depths up to   1500 m  . This is the first observation of electromagnetic-to-seismic coupling from surface electrodes and geophones. Electrodes at the earth's surface generate electric fields at the target and digital accelerometers detect the returning seismic wave. Conversion at depth is confirmed with hydrophones placed in wells. The gas sands yielded a linear ES response, as expected for electrokinetic energy conversion, and in qualitative agreement with numerical simulations. The carbonate oil reservoirs generate nonlinear conversions; a qualitatively new observation and a new probe of rock properties. The hard-rock results suggest applications in lithologies where seismic hydrocarbon indicators are weak. With greater effort, deeper penetration should be possible.",10.1190/1.2399458
Minimization Of Noise In Electromagnetic Exploration Systems,"The noise in electromagnetic (EM) surveys that originates in time‐dependent magnetic fields is quantified as a function of geographic location, season, and polarization. An overall variability of 104 is observed. The variance of the observed geophysical data caused by this noise is quantified in terms of the noise bandwidth of the signal‐processing system. While a time‐domain EM (TEM) system has a wide bandwidth for the target (i.e., synchronous) signal, it has a narrow bandwidth for the asynchronous EM noise. A procedure is developed to compute the magnetic moment required to provide a specified ratio of signal to noise (S/N) in the survey data for frequency‐domain EM (FEM) and both step‐ response and impulse‐response TEM. This procedure indicates that magnetic moments in the range 105 to 5×106A⋅m2 are necessary for moving transmitter systems, and up to 3×107A⋅m2 for fixed‐loop systems, for both frequency and time domain. A number of models of the overburden are established, and we show that the half‐space response is strongly dependent upon geology and weathering history. A variation of three orders of magnitude in the half‐space response occurs throughout the world. A procedure is defined to calculate the smallest target response detectable in the presence of a specified level of geologic noise. From this response we show that the overburden in the tropical and arid zones of the Earth strongly desensitizes the EM method. This is particularly severe for those styles of mineralization yielding short decay time constants. We conclude it would be impossible to detect targets with time constants 3 ms in substantial portions of the world's arid zone using EM alone. An overall survey design procedure is defined that determines whether a specified target would be detectable in the presence of the prevailing geologic noise, and the magnetic moment that would be required to detect it in the presence of the anticipated EM noise. The manner in which the primary field corrupts both frequency‐ and time‐domain systems is also analyzed, and we conclude that the TEM method is essentially free of primary field effects, while the simpler forms of FEM can be corrupted by primary field effects which obscure targets with secondary responses that are less than 10 percent of the primary field.",10.1190/1.1442134
Modeling Studies Of Interference Reflections In Thin‐Layered Media Bounded By Coal Seams,"High‐resolution seismic data collected over a major U.S. coal basin indicated potential complex problems associated with interference reflections. These problems differed from those normally encountered in the exploration of oil and gas because of differences in the geologic boundary conditions. Modeling studies were conducted to investigate the effects of overlapping primary reflections and the composite reflection that result from stacking individual wavelets. A modified empirical formula of Lindseth's linear relationship between acoustic impedance and velocity is used to extrapolate velocity information from density logs to provide appropriate geophysical properties for modeling. The synthetic seismograms generated from density and synthetic sonic logs correlated well with the processed seismic data. A 150-Hz Ricker wavelet is used to convolve with the computer models, and the models showed that certain anomalous composite reflections result from the superposition of overlapping primary reflections. Depending on the traveltime delay of latter primary reflections, constructive or destructive interference could significantly alter the signature of the initial reflection associated with the bed of interest, which may lead to misinterpretations if not properly identified. The stratigraphic modeling technique further enhances the interpretation process and shows a close correlation with the seismic data, suggesting that more precise analytical methods need to be used to interpret, sometimes complex, high‐resolution seismic data.",10.1190/1.1443336
High‐Resolution Crosswell Seismic Experiment With A Large Interwell Spacing In A West Texas Carbonate Field,"A high‐frequency crosswell seismic dataset acquired in a west Texas carbonate field has demonstrated the feasibility of the technique with a large interwell spacing. Two crosswell profiles were acquired with a well spacing of 1500 ft (460 m) and over a depth interval from 7700 ft (2350 m) to 9600 ft (2930 m) using a piezoelectric bender source. The data quality is profile and depth dependent, with the ambient noise level at the receiver position being the most important factor. Noise levels and noise characteristics among three wells were significantly different. Tube waves and gas‐ and fluid‐movement in the borehole are the dominant noise sources found in the data set. Two lithologic properties, attenuation and transmission loss controlled the data quality. Good quality and high frequency (1000 Hz) data were acquired over most of the survey interval which contains massive limestones. However, we could not acquire any useful data within the shale layers. Transmission losses and the effects of the source radiation pattern that occurred at interfaces with large impedance contrasts limited the aperture of the useful data. There were two critical issues encountered during the reflection imaging process: (1) sparse trace spacing and poor coherency of the reflection events in common‐source gathers degraded the image in a region near the receiver well; and (2) possible lateral velocity heterogeneity in the medium and limited aperture made it difficult to build an appropriate velocity model for reflection imaging.",10.1190/1.1443811
Potential‐Field Sounding Using Euler'S Homogeneity Equation And Zidarov Bubbling,"Potential‐field (gravity) data are transformed into a physical‐property (density) distribution in a lower half‐space, constrained solely by assumed upper bounds on physical‐property contrast and data error. A two‐step process is involved. The data are first transformed to an equivalent set of line (2-D case) or point (3-D case) sources, using Euler's homogeneity equation evaluated iteratively on the largest residual data value. Then, mass is converted to a volume‐density product, constrained to an upper density bound, by ""bubbling,"" which exploits circular or radial expansion to redistribute density without changing the associated gravity field. The method can be developed for gravity or magnetic data in two or three dimensions. The results can provide a beginning for interpretation of potential‐field data where few independent constraints exist, or more likely, can be used to develop models and confirm or extend interpretation of other geophysical data sets.",10.1190/1.1443649
Robust Estimation Of Primaries By Sparse Inversion Via One-Norm Minimization ,"A recently proposed method called estimation of primaries by sparse inversion (EPSI) avoids the need for adaptive subtraction of approximate multiple predictions by directly inverting for the multiple-free subsurface impulse response as a collection of band-limited spikes. Although it can be shown that the correct primary impulse response is obtained through the sparsest possible solution, the original EPSI algorithm was not designed to take advantage of this result, and instead it relies on a multitude of inversion parameters, such as the level of sparsity per gradient update. We proposed and tested a new algorithm, named robust EPSI, in which we make obtaining the sparsest solution an explicit goal. Our approach remains a gradient-based approach like the original algorithm, but it is derived from a new biconvex optimization framework based on an extended basis-pursuit denoising formulation. Furthermore, because it is based on a general framework, robust EPSI can recover the impulse response in transform domains, such as sparsifying curvelet-based representations, without changing the underlying algorithm. We discovered that the sparsity-minimizing objective of our formulation enabled it to operate successfully on a variety of synthetic and field marine data sets without excessive tweaking of inversion parameters. We also found that recovering the solution in alternate sparsity domains can significantly improve the quality of the directly estimated primaries, especially for weaker late-arrival events. In addition, we found that robust EPSI produces a more artifact-free impulse response compared to the original algorithm.",10.1190/geo2012-0097.1
High-Resolution Prestack Seismic Inversion Using A Hybrid Fista Least-Squares Strategy,"A new inversion method to estimate high-resolution amplitude-versus-angle attributes (AVA) attributes such as intercept and gradient from prestack data is presented. The proposed technique promotes sparse-spike reflectivities that, when convolved with the source wavelet, fit the observed data. The inversion is carried out using a hybrid two-step strategy that combines fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) and a standard least-squares (LS) inversion. FISTA, which can be viewed as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm, provides sparse solutions by minimizing the misfit between the modeled and the observed data, and the l1-norm of the solution. FISTA is used to estimate the location in time of the main reflectors. Then, LS is used to retrieve the appropriate reflectivity amplitudes that honor the data. FISTA, like other iterative solvers for l1-norm regularization, does not require matrices in explicit form, making it easy to apply, economic in computational terms, and adequate for solving large-scale problems. As a consequence, the FISTA+LS strategy represents a simple and cost-effective new procedure to solve the AVA inversion problem. Results on synthetic and field data show that the proposed hybrid method can obtain high-resolution AVA attributes from noisy observations, making it an interesting alternative to conventional methods.",10.1190/geo2013-0077.1
P-Wave Of Hydrate-Bearing Sand Under Temperature Cycling,"P-wave velocity was used to study the formation of gas hydrates that were formed from methane,   C O2   , and propane in the pores of sand particles under temperature cycling. During the temperature-cycling tests, additional hydrate or ice formation can be demonstrated by investigating the velocities and amplitude of the P-wave. The experiments indicated that temperature cycling can accelerate hydrate accumulation in the pore space of sediments. Although most of the water in the pore space of sand can transform into gas hydrate after several temperature cycles, the formation of propane hydrate was slower than that of methane hydrate or   C O2    hydrate. To estimate the hydrate saturation, an effective-medium theory was used. The results corroborated the validity of the contact model that the hydrate acted as a mineral grain to support the sediment frame. According to the calculation results, the methane-hydrate saturation can be up to 0.85 after three temperature cycles. The evaluation results accord with those of some natural hydrates in sand layers.",10.1190/1.3515263
Near‐Surface Thermal Prospecting: Review Of Processing And Interpretation,"Temperature measurements at shallow depths (up to 3 m) contain useful information about features of the geological structures in the areas under investigation; however, the noise caused by seasonal temperature variations and terrain relief effects may significantly distort the observed temperature field. Therefore, procedures are developed for the calculation and removal of these noise sources: (a) seasonal variations are first eliminated by a procedure using repeated observations; (b) terrain relief corrections are calculated by a correlation technique, which facilitates the identification of anomalies associated with concealed geological features. Essential similarities between thermal and magnetic prospecting make it possible to apply to thermal prospecting modifications of the rapid methods of characteristic points and tangents developed for magnetic prospecting. These methods are applicable to conditions of inclined relief, arbitrary magnetization polarization), and an unknown level of the normal field. The methods can be used to locate disturbing bodies by their associated temperature anomalies. Interpretation is made possible by approximating bodies by a dipping thin sheet or a horizontal circular cylinder. The interpretation results obtained both on models and polymetallic (Greater Caucasus) and oil and gas (Middle Kura Depression) deposits testify to the accuracy and reliability of these methods. These methods were also used successfully for interpretation of temperature anomaly over underground cavity in Cracov (Poland).",10.1190/1.1443632
Sea Magnetometer Reconnaissance Of Hudson Bay,"A total of 6,500 nautical miles of sea magnetometer data were obtained during the 1961 cruise of the M. V. THETA in Hudson Bay. Near the edge of the Bay the resultant magnetic profiles are made up of short‐wavelength, high‐amplitude anomalies whereas the anomalies in the center of the Bay are of longer wavelength and of lower amplitude. This is a reflection of the depth to the crystalline basement. This observation is confirmed by a quantitative interpretation of the magnetic profiles, which shows that, in general, the depths to basement are least around the margins of the Bay, with the greatest calculated depths, in excess of 10,000 feet, occurring in the area to the northeast of Churchill. The depth‐determination values also reveal that an asymmetrical troughlike basement feature occurs in the area between Southampton, Nottingham, Mansel, Coats, and Digges Islands.",10.1190/1.1439441
Asymptotic Elastic Green'S Tensor,"The Green's function for the acoustic wave equation has been an essential ingredient in obtaining frequency inversion formulas in the acoustic limit (Cohen and Bleistein, 1979; Clayton and Stolt, 1981; Beylkin, 1985; Cohen et al., 1986; Bleistein et al., 1987). Similarly, the Green's tensor is required for inversions based on the elastic wave equations. Indeed, Kuo and Dai (1984) and Dai and Kuo (1986) have already used an approximation to this tensor to derive a migration result for two‐component seismic data in the case of a homogeneous medium.",10.1190/1.1442536
The Horizontal Loop Electromagnetic Response Of A Thin Plate In A Conductive Earth: Part I—Computational Method,"The frequency‐domain EM response of a thin vertical tabular conductor situated in a two‐layer earth was obtained by solving the electric field integral equation numerically. The method of point collocation and expansion of the scattering current components in global polynomic basis functions was employed. Selection of polynomials which obey a boundary condition of no current flow from the edges had a beneficial effect on the results. As the number of basis functions increases, the solution converges to a stationary value which is valid over a sufficiently wide range of parameters to permit the computation of horizontal loop (Slingram) profiles over a plate which can be large enough to simulate a semi‐infinite half‐plane. The solution gradually worsens as the conductivity contrast between the plate and the host increases, and it eventually fails in situations where magnetic induction effects are strong and electric effects are negligible. The solution also worsens as the plate size increases or as the vertical magnetic dipole source approaches the plate.",10.1190/1.1441676
"A Numerical Homogenization Method For Heterogeneous, Anisotropic Elastic Media Based On Multiscale Theory","The development of reliable methods for upscaling fine-scale models of elastic media has long been an important topic for rock physics and applied seismology. Several effective medium theories have been developed to provide elastic parameters for materials such as finely layered media or randomly oriented or aligned fractures. In such cases, the analytic solutions for upscaled properties can be used for accurate prediction of wave propagation. However, such theories cannot be applied directly to homogenize elastic media with more complex, arbitrary spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, we have proposed a numerical homogenization algorithm based on multiscale finite-element methods for simulating elastic wave propagation in heterogeneous, anisotropic elastic media. Specifically, our method used multiscale basis functions obtained from a local linear elasticity problem with appropriately defined boundary conditions. Homogenized, effective medium parameters were then computed using these basis functions, and the approach applied a numerical discretization that was similar to the rotated staggered-grid finite-difference scheme. Comparisons of the results from our method and from conventional, analytical approaches for finely layered media showed that the homogenization reliably estimated elastic parameters for this simple geometry. Additional tests examined anisotropic models with arbitrary spatial heterogeneity in which the average size of the heterogeneities ranged from several centimeters to several meters, and the ratio between the dominant wavelength and the average size of the arbitrary heterogeneities ranged from 10 to 100. Comparisons to finite-difference simulations proved that the numerical homogenization was equally accurate for these complex cases.",10.1190/geo2014-0363.1
Dispersion Analysis Of An Average-Derivative Optimal Scheme For Laplace-Domain Scalar Wave Equation,"Laplace-domain modeling is an important foundation of Laplace-domain full-waveform inversion. However, dispersion analysis for Laplace-domain numerical schemes has not been completely established. This hampers the construction and optimization of Laplace-domain modeling schemes. By defining a pseudowavelength as a scaled skin depth, I establish a method for Laplace-domain numerical dispersion analysis that is parallel to its frequency-domain counterpart. This method is then applied to an average-derivative nine-point scheme for Laplace-domain scalar wave equation. Within the relative error of 1%, the Laplace-domain average-derivative optimal scheme requires four grid points per smallest pseudowavelength, whereas the classic five-point scheme requires 13 grid points per smallest pseudowavelength for general directional sampling intervals. The average-derivative optimal scheme is more accurate than the classic five-point scheme for the same sampling intervals. By using much smaller sampling intervals, the classic five-point scheme can approach the accuracy of the average-derivative optimal scheme, but the corresponding cost is much higher in terms of storage requirement and computational time.",10.1190/geo2013-0230.1
Separation Of S‐Wave And P‐Wave Reflections Offshore Western Florida,"Hard water‐bottom marine environments, such as offshore western Florida, have presented particular problems in the acquisition and processing of seismic reflection data. One problem has been the limited angle of incidence (less than critical) available to P‐wave penetration into the subsurface. Mode conversion from P‐wave to S‐waves (SV), however, is quite efficient over a broad range of angles of incidence. After the success of a previously reported physical model experiment, an experimental line was acquired offshore western Florida. The 19 mile line, located approximately 100 miles west of Key West, Florida, was shot and processed. Three key factors have contributed to the successful recording of mode‐converted S‐wave reflections: (1) recognition of the effect of the group length on attenuation of energy arriving at large angles of incidence; (2) tau‐p processing techniques that allow separation of energy by angle of incidence; and (3) velocity filtering over a range of hyperbolic normal‐moveout (NMO) velocities as part of the forward tau‐p transform. These three factors, two of them data processing techniques, have allowed separation of P‐ and S‐wave energy in the marine environment. Overall, S‐wave reflections have been unambiguously identified to a reflection time of 2 sec and may be interpreted to a reflection time of 2 sec. Integrating an S‐wave section with P‐wave interpretations of offshore Florida data allows an independent confirmation of structural events. This independent confirmation may be more significant than improvements in the P‐wave data quality alone. Lateraly stable tS/tP values are computed in intervals 1500 to 5000 ft thick and to S‐wave reflection times as great as 3 sec. The opportunity of tS/tP, interpretations for lithologic identification, gas thickness estimates, and general stratigraphic trap exploration makes mode‐converted shear waves a new tool in this area.",10.1190/1.1441685
A New Method For Interpretation Of Aeromagnetic Maps: Pseudo‐Gravimetric Anomalies,"The purpose of this paper is to describe a method of interpretation based on a transformation of the total magnetic intensity anomalies into simpler anomalies. The result of this transformation is the elimination of the distortion due to the obliquity of the normal magnetic field, so that the resulting anomalies will be located on the vertical of the disturbing magnetized bodies. The starting point of the theory is the well known relation between magnetic potential V and Newtonian potential U—relation which can be written: I→⋅grad⟶U=fσ⋅V, with: I→ = magnetization, f = 66.7×10−9 u ⋅CGS, σ = assumed density of magnetized bodies. This relation may be considered as a partial differential equation. The boundary condition consists in the measured values of the total field T(P ) known at each point P at the datum plane. As T(P) is the derivative of a harmonic function V, we can determine this function everywhere above the datum plane. Solving then the partial differential equation, we find the Newtonian potential U and its vertical derivatives g, g′, g″⋯. Finally, we obtain these quantities as functionals of the measured magnetic anomaly T(P). For instance, one of the formula is g(M)=12π∫∫H(M,P)T(P)dSP, where H(M, P) is the kernel of the transformation allowing the direct computation of g(M)—an anomalous field which will be called ""pseudo‐gravimetric anomaly."" Of course, the pseudo‐gravimetric anomaly has all the usual properties of a gravimetric anomaly. The field of g(M) presents no distortion and the interpretation becomes as easy as that of a Bouguer anomaly map. To perform the actual routine calculations of this transformation, we start with the values of T taken on a rectangular or trigonal grid, as for the usual computation of the vertical derivatives. The use of punched‐card equipment speeds up considerably these calculations.",10.1190/1.1438369
Joint Inversion Of P- And Ps-Waves In Orthorhombic Media: Theory And A Physical Modeling Study,"Reflection traveltimes recorded over azimuthally anisotropic fractured media can provide valuable information for reservoir characterization. As recently shown by Grechka and Tsvankin, normal moveout (NMO) velocity of any pure (unconverted) mode depends on only three medium parameters and usually has an elliptical shape in the horizontal plane. Because of the limited information contained in the NMO ellipse of P-waves, it is advantageous to use moveout velocities of shear or converted modes in attempts to resolve the coefficients of realistic orthorhombic or lower‐symmetry fractured models. Joint inversion of P and PS traveltimes is especially attractive because it does not require shear‐wave excitation. Here, we show that for models composed of horizontal layers with a horizontal symmetry plane, the traveltime of converted waves is reciprocal with respect to the source and receiver positions (i.e., it remains the same if we interchange the source and receiver) and can be adequately described by NMO velocity on conventional‐length spreads. The azimuthal dependence of converted‐wave NMO velocity has the same form as for pure modes but requires the spatial derivatives of two-way traveltime for its determination. Using the generalized Dix equation of Grechka, Tsvankin, and Cohen, we derive a simple relationship between the NMO ellipses of pure and converted waves that provides a basis for obtaining shear‐wave information from P and PS data. For orthorhombic models, the combination of the reflection traveltimes of the P-wave and two split PS-waves makes it possible to reconstruct the azimuthally dependent NMO velocities of the pure shear modes and to find the anisotropic parameters that cannot be determined from P-wave data alone. The method is applied to a physical modeling data set acquired over a block of orthorhombic material—Phenolite XX-324. The inversion of conventional‐spread P and PS moveout data allowed us to obtain the orientation of the vertical symmetry planes and eight (out of nine) elastic parameters of the medium (the reflector depth was known). The remaining coefficient (c12 or δ(3) in Tsvankin's notation) is found from the direct P-wave arrival in the horizontal plane. The inversion results accurately predict moveout curves of the pure S-waves and are in excellent agreement with direct measurements of the horizontal velocities.",10.1190/1.1444512
Ultrasonic Leaky Flexural Waves In Multilayered Media: Cement Bond Detection For Cased Wellbores,"Good cement bond quality is significant for an oil well to prevent hydraulic communication between zones and to ensure layered exploitation. Conventional sonic logging techniques are limited to the detection region immediately behind the casing, so they can hardly be used to interpret the bonding quality between cement and rock formations. To develop a cementing evaluation method for the whole annulus, ultrasonic leaky flexural modes in radially multilayered media were investigated through finite-difference modeling. The guided waves were excited and received by pitch-catch transducers arranged in the borehole. According to the numerical results, two kinds of flexural modes were sensitive to cement debonding at different interfaces, respectively. For the primary flexural waves that arrived early and propagated all along the casing, the attenuation levels decreased due to the appearance of a fluid-filled channel between the casing and the cement sheath. The acoustic signals arriving later were the secondary flexural modes contributed by reflection echoes from the formation. They will be greatly strengthened once a debonding defect appears at the cement-formation boundary, and the arrival time of secondary flexural waves can also be applied to predict the thickness of the cement sheath. Consequently, it is possible to propose an integrated evaluation for both interfaces of the cement annulus by extracting properties of the primary and secondary flexural waves.",10.1190/geo2013-0361.1
Seismic Waves Generated By An Impulsive Point Source In A Solid/Fluid Configuration With A Plane Boundary,"The space‐time acoustic wave motion generated by an impulsive point source in a solid/fluid configuration with a vertical plane boundary is calculated with the aid of the modified Cagniard method. Two types of sources are considered in detail, viz. (1) a point source of expansion (model for an explosive source), and (2) a point force parallel to the vertical interface (model for a mechanical vibrator). Numerical results are presented for the transmitted scalar traction in the fluid in those regions of space where head wave contributions occur. There is a marked difference in the time response observed for the two types of sources and for the different positions of the receiver in the fluid with respect to the position of the source in the solid. These waveform differences are important when the transmitted wave in the fluid is used to determine experimentally the elastic properties of the solid. Scholte waves are observed only when the source is close to the fluid/solid interface. As compared with the traditional Fourier‐Bessel integral transform method of handling this problem, the computation time with the method presented here is considerably less.",10.1190/1.1441980
"High‐Resolution Seismic Study In The Gas Hills Uranium District, Wyoming","A study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of the high‐resolution seismic technique for the mapping of stratigraphic and structural controls in the Gas Hills uranium district, Wyoming. The test area is one in which uranium deposits are in Tertiary sediments which unconformably overlie a Mesozoic Paleozoic section. Paleochannels on the unconformity appear to control the localization of the uranium. Drilling in the area allows an evaluation of the effectiveness of the study. Using both sonic and density logs, we computed synthetic seismograms to evaluate the feasibility of predicting the success of the seismic reflection technique and to test this prediction using surface seismic methods. The field study was undertaken utilizing primarily two energy sources—a high‐frequency vibrator (40–350 Hz), and one‐pound dynamite charges shot in 10-ft holes. A limited amount of data was also acquired using detonating cord on the surface. Some three‐dimensional (3-D) data were also acquired, and a later study acquired passive seismic data. The seismic reflection data were successful not only in delineating the unconformable surface and in mapping paleodrainages on the unconformity, but also in defining channel deposits within the Tertiary section. Correlation with the logs shows the success of the study. Several areas were delineated where one would undertake tight drilling patterns, and other areas were delineated in which one might minimize or eliminate exploratory drilling. The synthetic seismograms also could have predicted the success of the seismic work.",10.1190/1.1441286
"High-Resolution Seismic Imaging In Complex Environments: A Comparison Among Common-Reflection-Surface Stack, Common-Midpoint Stack, And Prestack Depth Migration At The Ilva-Bagnoli Brownfield Site, Campi Flegrei, Italy","I used the common-reflection-surface (CRS) stack technique together with conventional common-midpoint processing and prestack depth migration (PSDM) to process three parallel high-resolution seismic reflection lines acquired in a closed industrial plant. This brownfield site, now undergoing remediation, is located within the Bagnoli district of the city of Naples, Italy, near the southeastern border of Campi Flegrei caldera. Compared with the other results, the CRS stack, followed by poststack depth migration, produced a seismic image more consistent with the expected subsurface structures and with outcropping units present in the area. The survey confirmed the presence under the brownfield site of some buried steps of Coroglio Fault, a main structure formed approximately 15  ky ago, during the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff supereruption. Results have important implications for hazard assessment and geothermal exploration because the imaged faults certainly are preferential passageways for geothermal fluids and washed pollutants. These tests revealed that the common-reflection-surface stack can be a fast and cost-effective alternative to PSDM in settings in which structural complexity and high levels of ambient noise make it challenging to obtain a reliable background velocity model; therefore, allowing high-resolution reflection seismology to be successfully used in those environments.",10.1190/geo2014-0488.1
2.5D Resistivity Modeling Of Embankment Dams To Assess Influence From Geometry And Material Properties,"Repeated resistivity measurement is a potentially powerful method for monitoring development of internal erosion and anomalous seepage in earth embankment dams. This study is part of a project to improve current longterm monitoring routines and data interpretation and increasing the understanding when interpreting existing data. This is accomplished by modeling various occurrences typical of embankment structures using properties from two rockfill embankment dams with central till cores in the north of Sweden. The study evaluates the influence from 3D effects created by specific dam geometry and effects of water level fluctuations in the reservoir. Moreover, a comparison between different layout locations is carried out, and detectability of internal erosion scenarios is estimated through modeling of simulated damage situations. Software was especially developed to model apparent resistivity for geometries and material distributions for embankment dams. The model shows that the 3D effect from the embankment geometry is clearly significant when measuring along dam crests. For dams constructed with a conductive core of fine-grained soil and high-resistive rockfill, the effect becomes greatly enhanced. Also, water level fluctuations have a clear effect on apparent resistivities. Only small differences were found between the investigated arrays. A layout along the top of the crest is optimal for monitoring on existing dams, where intrusive investigations are normally avoided, because it is important to pass the current through the conductive core, which is often the main target of investigation. The investigation technique has proven beneficial for improving monitoring routines and increasing the understanding of results from the ongoing monitoring programs. Although the technique and software are developed for dam modeling, it could be used for estimation of 3D influence on any elongated structure with a 2D cross section.",10.1190/1.2198217
Synthetic Seismic Sections Of Typical Petroleum Traps,"Interpretation of seismic reflections remains a key problem in seismic exploration because reflections have complex behavior, especially near geologic structures. One method to gain an understanding of this complex behavior is to study synthetic seismic sections of models of typical petroleum traps as computed by zero‐offset ray tracing for primary P‐waves only. These synthetic sections have features of significant interpretative value to the practicing geophysicist, such as variations in reflection amplitudes and complexities in reflection‐time geometries. Asymptotic ray theory was applied to calculate reflection amplitudes, accounting for mode conversion and three‐dimensional geometric divergence of ray tubes in the presence of curvilinear interfaces. This suite of synthetic seismic sections illustrates the difficulties in making correct seismic interpretations of geologic structures and suggests three conclusions: (1) The customary assumption that seismic sections are simple images of geologic cross‐sections is an oversimplification and can lead to erroneous interpretations. (2) Variations in overlying strata produce marked disturbances in reflection amplitude and traveltime. (3) Critical reflections that provide key structural information are often difficult to recognize and are apt to be ignored, or misidentified, especially if trace processing has been cursory. A fundamental principle of interpretation is underscored by this study: CDP stacked seismic sections must be interpreted so as to be consistent with structural depth models because stacked sections are not simple images of geologic structures.",10.1190/1.1440883
"Problems And Interpretation Of Cocorp Deep Seismic Reflection Data, Wind River Range, Wyoming","Before the Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling (COCORP) deep crustal reflection profile across the Wind River range, Wyoming, can be understood, problems involving velocity, multiple reflections, and structural style associated with thrusting must be resolved. Measurements from boreholes to maximum depths of 7.8 km show that a strong velocity inversion is associated with overpressured zones, primarily in Cretaceous shales. One‐dimensional (1-D) synthetic seismograms generated using the detailed velocity distribution closely duplicate the seismic trace on line 1 and produce multiple reflections of significant amplitude to record times of l0 sec. Other data including auto‐correlograms demonstrate presence of abundant multiple reflection energy to times of 10 to 12 sec on lines 1 and 2 and suggest that most of the deep events on these lines are multiple reflections. Because this area has not been known as a problem area for multiples in shallow (industry) reflection surveys, we conclude that multiples are a greater impediment for deep crustal reflection studies than has previously been recognized and that the sedimentary section must be treated much like the weathered zone in shallow seismic studies. Two‐dimensional (2-D) modeling and hand migration are used to determine structure in sedimentary rocks beneath the thrust Precambrian wedge. They suggest that structural as well as velocity uplift is found under the thrust, that a wedge of overturned sedimentary rocks parallels the thrust, and that the deeper sedimentary rocks bend down into the thrust.",10.1190/1.1441176
Tour Of Petroleum Geophysics Activities In The U.S.S.R.,"Six American geophysicists spent three weeks in the U.S.S.R. during the early fall of 1965 as members of an exchange delegation in petroleum geophysics set up under the terms of a treaty on technical exchanges between the U. S. and the U.S.S.R. The group visited eleven different activities located in four cities, Moscow, Oktyabr'skiy, Krasnodar, and Leningrad. These activities included a number of geophysical and geological research institutes, the Moscow State University, and the Gubkin Institute. The principal difference between exploration geophysics in the U.S.S.R. and in the Western countries is the great emphasis in Soviet oil exploration on regional studies as a preliminary to the more direct search for petroleum deposits. As a result of such emphasis, their exploration program involves much greater use than ours of long refraction lines, electrical prospecting, and aeromagnetic surveys with close line spacing. Reflection work follows conventional lines without such recent refinements as common depth point shooting, impact sources, or vibrators. A possible reason these newer field techniques are not used is that no processing equipment appears to be generally available for compositing signals from more than one tape on to a single channel. Seismic shear waves generated at the surface have given reflections from depths as great as 5,000 ft but they have thus far been used only on an experimental basis. A technique of recording ""exchange"" (PS) waves from earthquakes has been employed for mapping basement depths in regional investigations.",10.1190/1.1439801
Traveltime Calculations From Frequency‐Domain Downward‐Continuation Algorithms,"By using the one‐way downgoing wave equation, we also circumvent generating traveltimes corresponding to near‐surface upcoming head waves not often needed in migration. We compare the traveltimes computed by our algorithm with those obtained by picking the most energetic arrivals from finite‐difference solutions of the one‐way wave equation, and show that our traveltime calculation method yields traveltimes comparable to solutions of the one‐way wave equation. We illustrate the accuracy of our traveltime algorithm by migrating the 2D IFP Marmousi and the 3D SEG/EAGE salt models.",10.1190/1.1598131
"Improved Fourier Terrain Correction, Part Ii","Fourier methods for potential fields have always been developed with the simplification that the calculation surface is a level plane. The Fourier approach can be extended to deal with an uneven observation surface. I consider the case of terrain correction for gravity surveys, in which the attraction of a variable‐thickness layer is calculated at points on its upper surface. The main idea is to use a power series in topographic height that is then converted into a series of convolutions. To avoid convergence problems, a cylindrical zone around the observer must be removed from the Fourier treatment and its contribution computed directly. The resultant algorithm is very fast: in an example based on a recent survey, the new method is shown to be more than 300 times faster than a calculation based on summing contributions from a column of material under each topographic grid point.",10.1190/1.1443965
Gravimagnetic Anomaly Formulas For Polyhedra Of Spatially Linear Media,"The formulas are analyzed for singularities and for numerical error growth. Error growth with increasing target distance is found to be higher than in the corresponding uniform polyhedral case. Examination of the error sources reveals that some error reduction is possible. On this basis, new algorithms of improved error control over existing algorithms are proposed for the linear medium. Computational results confirm the expected improvement.",10.1190/1.1543203
Sensitivity Analysis Of Fracture Scattering,"We use 2D and 3D finite-difference modeling to numerically calculate the seismic response of a single finite fracture with a linear-slip boundary in a homogeneous elastic medium. We use a point explosive source and ignore the free surface effect, so the fracture scattered wavefield contains two parts: P-to-P scattering and P-to-S scattering. The elastic response of the fracture is described by the fracture compliance. We vary the incident angle and fracture compliance within a range considered appropriate for field observations and investigate the P-to-P and P-to-S scattering patterns of a single fracture. P-to-P and P-to-S fracture scattering patterns are sensitive to the ratio of normal to tangential fracture compliance and incident angle, whereas the scattering amplitude is proportional to the compliance, which agrees with the Born scattering analysis. We find that, for a vertical fracture, if the source is located at the surface, most of the energy scattered by the fracture propagates downwards. We also study the effect of fracture height on the scattering pattern and scattering amplitude.",10.1190/geo2011-0521.1
Comparison Of 2-D Numerical Viscoelastic Waveform Modeling With Ultrasonic Physical Modeling,"The objective of the study is to test the validity of theoretical models of wave attenuation by comparing their predictions of attenuation against physical model results. The study is confined to a 2-D geometry, and the viscoelastic materials used in physical modeling are those commonly used in the experiment. The physical modeling data of homogeneous media are compared with the numerical results in the frequency domain. The time‐domain comparisons between numerical modeling and physical modeling are also shown by three examples. The theoretical viscoelastic models used in the numerical study are the Kelvin‐Voigt model, the standard linear solid model, and the standard linear solid model with a continuous spectrum of relaxation time. On the comparison of a single model, all the models simulate the physical model fairly well, but the standard linear solid model gives the best result among them. The Kelvin‐Voigt model is easy to use as a quick first‐order simulation of the viscoelastic materials because it has fewer viscosity parameters than the other two models. The disadvantage of the Kelvin‐Voigt model is that it predicts too much attenuation of the high‐frequency components. It is also shown that neglecting the viscosity of some materials like polyvinylcloride plastic (PVC), which has high viscosity, will produce incorrect results in synthetic seismograms.",10.1190/1.1444011
Two‐Dimensional Joint Inversion Of Magnetotelluric And Dipole‐Dipole Resistivity Data,"This paper describes 2-D joint inversion of MT and dipole‐dipole resistivity data with the emphasis on the computer algorithm. The algorithm produces a 2-D model composed of a large number of rectangular blocks, each of which has constant resistivity. The solutions to  two forward problems are based on the finite‐element method. The computation time for the partial derivatives of MT responses is reduced by using the reciprocity relation and the concept of a fictitious source. The smoothness‐constrained least‐squares method, together with the modified Gram‐Schmidt method, is also to stabilize the solution and avoid spurious resistivity features. Synthetic and field data examples show that the 2-D joint inversion can be effective for improving the resolution attained by the 2-D interpretation of a single kind of data set.",10.1190/1.1442649
Reverse-Time Migration In Parallel: A Tutorial,"A reverse-time migration is implemented on a fine-grain or massively parallel computer. With fine-grain architectures many processors are distributed throughout the memory space and can operate on data ""in place."" In addition, via a general communication system, any processor can access data from anywhere in the entire memory-processor space. Thus, operations on both local and global data elements are possible. These capabilities are controlled by parallel language constructs which allow parallel variable declaration, parallel arithmetic operation, and parallel random memory access. Reverse-time migration was programmed on a fine-grain machine with these hardware and software features. The reverse-time migration process had a speed improvement of two orders of magnitude relative to a state-of-the-art serial machine. At least another order of magnitude performance can be achieved with currently available floating-point processors. Similar increases in performance are expected for other seismic processes such as velocity estimation, data interpolation, 2-D filtering, and others.",10.1190/1.1442553
Characterization Of Interbedded Thin Beds Using Zero-Crossing-Time Amplitude Stratal Slices,"We have developed a novel method to characterize thin beds using zero-crossing-time (ZCT) amplitude slices based on an interesting phenomenon we have noticed. Because of the reflection interferences and wavelet overlap, it is almost impossible to identify each thin bed from the composite response of interbedded thin beds. However, the seismic response of one thin bed does not always interfere with other thin beds at all times. At its ZCTs, a thin bed's reflection makes no contribution to the composite response. Therefore, unlike standard amplitude stratal slices, the imprint of a thin bed does not appear in its ZCT amplitude stratal slices. The latter makes the interference pattern of ZCT amplitude stratal slices different from those of other amplitude stratal slices. Based on this difference, the ZCT amplitude stratal slices of each thin bed can be identified from consecutive amplitude slices, and the thickness, depth, and lateral distribution of each thin bed, as well as the vertical spacing between them, can be estimated from their ZCTs. This interpretive method has been systematically tested with synthetic 3D data and has also been applied to field seismic data.",10.1190/geo2014-0608.1
Dithering Of Absorbers For Efficient Finite‐Difference Modeling Of Viscoelastic Wave Propagation,"Viscoelastic modeling traditionally uses multiple relaxation mechanisms (absorbers) per wave type in each cell of the numerical grid. We show that one absorber per cell suffices when the absorbers of different relaxation frequencies and absorption strengths are dithered in a supercell, i.e., a very small area of several nearby cells. The relaxation frequencies used in a supercell can be preselected to cover the bandwidth required in the modeling and distributed locally in a random manner to minimize numerical scattering. The absorption strengths, however, must be found iteratively to yield an average absorption that matches the desired medium over the bandwidth. We have tested the dithered‐absorber method for modeling a variety of 2-D media using a staggered‐grid finite‐difference scheme. For a uniform medium, our result agrees well with the exact analytic solution. For inhomogeneous models, the dithered‐absorber solution agrees well with the finite‐difference solution computed with five absorbers per cell. The computer time and memory requirements of the dithered‐absorber method are only ≈60% and ≈40% of those with five absorbers per cell. In all cases, random numerical scattering is very small—typically less than similar types of error because of model discretization.",10.1190/1.1444474
3D Scalar-Wave Absorbing Boundary Conditions With Optimal Coefficients In The Frequency-Space Domain,"To improve the computational efficiency for the solution of the 3D Helmholtz equation in the frequency-space domain, high-order compact forms of finite differences are preferred. We applied a pointwise Padé approximation to develop a 3D 27-point fourth-order compact finite-difference (FD) stencil in the grid interior, with a space-differentiated source term, for the scalar-wave equation; this has similar high-accuracy (4–5 grid points per the shortest wavelength) to another 27-point fourth-order FD stencil using a parsimonious mixed-grid and staggered-grid combination, but is much simpler. For absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs), a damping zone is expensive, and a perfectly matched layer can not be straightforwardly introduced into the compact FD form for the second-order wave equation. Thus, we developed 3D one-way wave equation (OWWE) ABCs with adjustable coefficients. They have different angle approximations and FD forms for the six faces, twelve edges, and eight corners in 3D models to fit with the interior compact FD form. By adjusting the coefficients to the optimum, the OWWE ABCs have wider-angle absorbing ability than those without optimal coefficients. Finally, all the interior and boundary FD forms were combined into a sparse complex-valued impedance matrix of the frequency-space modeling equation, and solved for each frequency. Because the storage of the sparse impedance matrix was determined by the 3D discrete grid size, the OWWE ABCs with only one outer layer needed the minimum grid size compared with other ABCs, thus were the most efficient for the solution of the impedance matrix. The modeling algorithm was performed on multicore processors using a MPI parallel direct solver. Numerical tests on homogeneous and heterogeneous models gave satisfactory absorbing effects.",10.1190/geo2011-0412.1
Transverse Isotropy Versus Lateral Heterogeneity In The Inversion Of P-Wave Reflection Traveltimes,"Nonelliptic transverse isotropy may cause pronounced nonhyperbolic moveout of long‐spread P-wave reflection data. Lateral heterogeneity may alter the moveout in much the same way, and one can expect that a given P-wave reflection moveout may be interpreted equally well in terms of parameters of homogeneous transversely isotropic (TI) or laterally heterogeneous (LH) isotropic models. Here, the common‐midpoint (CMP) moveout of a P-wave reflected from a horizontal interface beneath a weakly laterally heterogeneous medium that is also weakly transversely isotropic is represented analytically in the form similar to that in homogeneous TI media. Both the normal‐moveout (NMO) velocity and the quartic moveout coefficient contain derivatives of the zero‐ offset traveltime t0 and the NMO velocity Vnmo with respect to the lateral coordinate. Despite the presence of heterogeneity, nonhyperbolic velocity analysis can be performed in the same way as in homogeneous TI models. If all parameters of the medium are linear functions of the lateral coordinate, heterogeneity does not influence the results of inversion for the anisotropic parameter η. However, to find η in the case of general lateral heterogeneity, the second derivative of Vnmo and the fourth derivative of t0 are needed. Since these high‐order derivatives are calculated from the data measured at discrete points by numerical differentiation, stability of η estimation is further reduced as compared to that in homogeneous TI media. Consequently, the trade‐off between anisotropy and heterogeneity significantly complicates the inversion of P-wave reflection traveltimes, even in the simplest model of a single plane layer.",10.1190/1.1444314
Controlled‐Source Audiomagnetotellurics In Geothermal Exploration,"Theoretical and field tests indicate that the controlled‐source audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) method provides an efficient means of delineating the shallow resistivity pattern above a hydrothermal system. Utilizing a transmitter overcomes the main limitation of conventional audiomagnetotellurics—variable and unreliable natural source fields. Reliable CSAMT measurements can be made with a simple scalar receiver. Our calculations for a half‐space show that the plane‐wave assumption is valid when the transmitter is more than 3 skin depths away in the broadside configuration and more than 5 skin depths away in the collinear configuration. Three‐dimensional (3-D) numerical modeling results for a bipole source 5 skin depths away compare well with those for a plane‐wave source, showing that the method is valid. A CSAMT survey at the Roosevelt Hot Springs geothermal area in Utah produced apparent resistivity contour maps at four frequencies: 32, 98, 977, and 5208 Hz. These maps show the same features as those of a dipole‐dipole resistivity map. We also collected detailed CSAMT data at 10 frequencies on two profiles. Two‐dimensional (2-D) plane‐wave modeling (transverse magnetic mode) of the resulting pseudo‐sections yields models similar to those derived by modeling the dipole‐dipole resistivity data. However, CSAMT resolved details not shown by the resistivity modeling. Thus, high resolution along with an efficient field procedure make CSAMT an attractive tool for geothermal exploration.",10.1190/1.1441272
Wavelet-Radon Domain Dealiasing And Interpolation Of Seismic Data,"Spatial aliasing is unavoidable in some seismic data and has serious effects on the performance of multichannel data processing and migration. Antialias filtering produces distortion of the signal through the removal of high-frequency information. In contrast, dealiasing produces an unaliased estimate of the signal at all frequencies present in the original time series. A new dealiasing algorithm is developed by exploiting the properties of seismic wavefields in the wavelet-Radon transform domain, specifically the overlap of information between wavelet scales at the same frequency. The effectiveness of the wavelet-Radon dealiasing algorithm is demonstrated through the processing of both synthetic and field seismic data.",10.1190/1.2422797
An Inverse Method Of Magnetotelluric Analysis For A Multilayered Earth,"In the inverse method of analysis, the model for the resistivity structure is deduced from the data. An iterative process is developed wherein the maximum residual between the measured data and the theoretically deduced values for a successively increasing number of layers is reduced to a value less than the scatter in the data. In carrying out this procedure the parameters for each successive layer are determined and the number of layers required in the interpretation is determined by both the spectral range of the data and the scatter.",10.1190/1.1439999
Application Of A Linear Finite-Frequency Theory To Time-Lapse Crosswell Tomography In Ultrasonic And Numerical Experiments,"Time-lapse seismic monitoring is the geophysical discipline whereby multiple data sets recorded at the same location but at different times are used to locate and quantify temporal changes in the elastic parameters of the subsurface. We validate a time-lapse monitoring method by crosswell tomography using two types of wavefield-modeling experiments: (1) a 3D real ultrasonic waveform experiment and (2) 2D synthetic finite-difference wavefield simulations. For both wavefield experiments, a time-lapse structure simulating a fluid sweep in a reservoir layer is applied. The time-lapse tomographic monitoring approach is based on the standard ray theory and a finite-frequency wavefield theory, where the latter takes into account the finite-frequency properties of recorded wavefields. The inverted time-lapse models compiled with either the ray theory or the finite-frequency wavefield theory locate and correctly quantify the flooding zone in the simulated fluid sweep model. Both wavefield theories provide an adequate result because the flooding zone is comparable in size to the Fresnel volume.",10.1190/1.2778767
Education And The Petroleum Industry,"At a meeting of the Institute of Petroleum held at the Royal Society of Arts in London, April 29, 1943, Professor V. C. Illing, a Vice‐President of the Institute, delivered a paper entitled Education and the Petroleum Industry which was published in the Journal of the Institute of Petroleum, Vol. 29, No. 238, pp. 259–283 (October, 1943). The section on exploration appeared to be of particular interest: consequently, permission was secured from Professor Illing and the Institute to reprint it. (Editor's Note.)",10.1190/1.1445077
Sparse Time-Frequency Representation For Seismic Noise Reduction Using Low-Rank And Sparse Decomposition,"Attenuation of random noise is a major concern in seismic data processing. This kind of noise is usually characterized by random oscillation in seismic data over the entire time and frequency. We introduced and evaluated a low-rank and sparse decomposition-based method for seismic random noise attenuation. The proposed method, which is a trace by trace algorithm, starts by transforming the seismic signal into a new sparse subspace using the synchrosqueezing transform. Then, the sparse time-frequency representation (TFR) matrix is decomposed into two parts: (a) a low-rank component and (b) a sparse component using bilateral random projection. Although seismic data are not exactly low-rank in the sparse TFR domain, they can be assumed as being of semi-low-rank or approximately low-rank type. Hence, we can recover the denoised seismic signal by minimizing the mixed ℓ1‐ℓ2 norms' objective function by considering the intrinsically semilow-rank property of the seismic data and sparsity feature of random noise in the sparse TFR domain. The proposed method was tested on synthetic and real data. In the synthetic case, the data were contaminated by random noise. Denoising was carried out by means of the f-x classical singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and f-x deconvolution method for comparison. The f-x deconvolution and the classical f-x SSA method failed to properly reduce the noise and to recover the desired signal. We have also tested the proposed method on a prestack real data set from an oil field in the southwest of Iran. Through synthetic and real tests, the proposed method is determined to be an effective, amplitude preserving, and robust tool that gives superior results over classical f-x SSA as conventional algorithm for denoising seismic data.",10.1190/geo2015-0341.1
The Lattice Filter In Ground‐Roll Suppression,"Seismic reflections are sometimes masked by Ray‐leigh‐type surface waves that are termed ground roll in seismic literature. An adaptive lattice filter is used to recover reflected signals contaminated by ground roll. Experiments on synthetic and field data showed that the adaptive lattice filter technique is very effective in ground‐roll elimination. In addition, the filter works as a whitening operator, compresses the signal, and increases the signal‐to‐noise ratio.",10.1190/1.1443622
On The Problem Of Estimating The Depth To The Magnetic Basement,"In many applications in aeromagnetics, the estimation of the depth to the crystalline magnetic basement is of great importance. Of many approaches to this problem, the most widely applied appear to be based upon Fourier analysis (see Ruotoistenmäki, 1987) or on fitting hypothetical models to observed data using a least‐squares principle (for example, Leite and Leão, 1985). Recently, some interest has been focused on direct approaches to the problem (Strakhov and Brodsky, 1986; Koch and Tarlowski, 1986; and Jonca and Vogel, 1987).",10.1190/1.1442415
Numerical Evaluation Of The Transient Acoustic Waveform Due To A Point Source In A Fluid‐Filled Borehole,"A key measurement employed in oil well wireline logging is the acoustic wave traveltime over a specified formation interval, typically 1 ft. In the traditional measurement, only the compressional head wave is monitored, but for some time it has been obvious that there is significant additional information, such as the shear head wave arrival, in the received waveform. We describe two numerical methods for computing the profile and parameter dependence of the transient waveform based on a model of the acoustic logging problem consisting of a point source on the axis of a fluid‐filled cylindrical borehole. The response to this excitation is determined at a distance from the source, generally on the borehole axis. In the first of the two numerical methods, called ""real axis integration"", the complete acoustic waveform is obtained. The second method, called ""branch‐cut integration"", evaluates the first compressional and shear‐pseudo‐Rayleigh arrivals individually with much less computation time than the first method. The validity and accuracy of the two methods are demonstrated by their close agreement within appropriate time windows. It is also shown that the results from the ordinary asymptotic method that exist in the literature predict different behavior. The dependence of the transient arrivals on formation parameters is illustrated by various numerical results in both time and frequency domains.",10.1190/1.1440932
A Fast Interpretation Of Self-Potential Data Using The Depth From Extreme Points Method,"We used a fast method to interpret self-potential data: the depth from extreme points (DEXP) method. This is an imaging method transforming self-potential data, or their derivatives, into a quantity proportional to the source distribution. It is based on upward continuing of the field to a number of altitudes and then multiplying the continued data with a scaling law of those altitudes. The scaling law is in the form of a power law of the altitudes, with an exponent equal to half of the structural index, a source parameter related to the type of source. The method is autoconsistent because the structural index is basically determined by analyzing the scaling function, which is defined as the derivative of the logarithm of the self-potential (or of its pth derivative) with respect to the logarithm of the altitudes. So, the DEXP method does not need a priori information on the self-potential sources and yields effective information about their depth and shape/typology. Important features of the DEXP method are its high-resolution power and stability, resulting from the combined effect of a stable operator (upward continuation) and a high-order differentiation operator. We tested how to estimate the depth to the source in two ways: (1) at the positions of the extreme points in the DEXP transformed map and (2) at the intersection of the lines of the absolute values of the potential or of its derivative (geometrical method). The method was demonstrated using synthetic data of isolated sources and using a multisource model. The method is particularly suited to handle noisy data, because it is stable even using high-order derivatives of the self-potential. We discussed some real data sets: Malachite Mine, Colorado (USA), the Sariyer area (Turkey), and the Bender area (India). The estimated depths and structural indices agree well with the known information.",10.1190/geo2012-0074.1
Choice Of Operator Length For Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis,Empirical evidence based on maximum entropy spectra of real seismic data suggests that M = 2N/ln 2N is a reasonable a priori choice of the operator length M for discrete time series of length N. Various examples support this conclusion.,10.1190/1.1440902
Seismogram Synthesis For Radially Layered Media Using The Generalized Reflection/Transmission Coefficients Method: Theory And Applications To Acoustic Logging,"A new method based on generalized reflection and transmission coefficients is proposed to calculate the synthetic seismograms in radially multilayered media. This method can be used to efficiently simulate full waveform acoustic logs and crosswell seismic profiles in situations where we need to consider borehole effects. The new formulation is tested by comparing our numerical results with previous available work and shows excellent agreement. Because of the use of the normalized Hankel functions and the normalization factors, this new algorithm for computing seismograms is stable numerically even for high‐frequency problems. To show the applicability of this new approach to full waveform sonic logging, we apply it to investigate the effects of complex invaded zones on the geometrical spreading and attenuation estimation for P‐waves. We find that a damaged zone (its velocity is slower than the unperturbed formation velocity) exhibits a convergence effect on the P‐waves, and a flushed zone (velocity is faster than the unperturbed formation velocity) exhibits a divergence effect on the P‐waves.",10.1190/1.1444035
Radiation Patterns Of Torsionally Vibrating Seismic Sources,"The radiation patterns available in the literature for seismic surface sources are restricted to far‐field, low‐frequency solutions for undamped half‐space models. A theoretical study of the radiation pattern of a circular baseplate vibrating torsionally on the surface of an N-layered anelastic medium demonstrates that the patterns in the literature do not reasonably represent the radiated field of a source on a damped layered medium. The radiation pattern of a source is a measure of the strength of the output signal as a function of direction and is determined by calculating the displacements at points along the arc of a circle at a specified radial distance from the source. The solution for the displacement due to a vibrator or a plane‐layered anelastic medium is obtained by solving the elastodynamic wave equation using Fourier and Hankel transforms. The displacement is expressed in terms of an inverse Hankel transform which is performed numerically. The shape of the torsional radiation pattern in a half‐space is a function of frequency, baseplate radius, shear‐wave velocity, and radial distance between the source and the observation points. As frequency increases, the source beams more energy in a near‐vertical direction, and less in directions near the horizontal. Vertical beaming also increases as baseplate radius increases and as shear‐wave velocity decreases. The radiated field approaches an asymptotic far‐field radiation pattern at radial distances in excess of 5 to 8 baseplate radii. In a layered medium, constructive and destructive interference of direct, reflected, and refracted waves results in a characteristic lobate structure in the radiated field. A minimum occurs just below the layer interface due to the combined effects of reflections and refractions. As frequency increases, a greater proportion of energy penetrates the layer interface and enters the underlying medium. At frequencies typically used in exploration seismology the majority of the signal from a torsional source is trapped in the surface layer. The shape of the radiation pattern at a given distance from the source is a function of the density, velocity, and Q contrasts between layers. For a given acoustic impedance contrast, more energy is trapped in the surface layer if the contrast is caused primarily by a velocity rather than a density change since the velocity contrast results not only in reflections but also in refractions and Love waves. A variation in Q between layers further distorts the radiated field. The pattern for a layered model does not asymptote to a far‐field pattern until the radial distance is much greater than the total thickness of the layers in the model. Radiation pattern modeling for layered media may help resolve the discrepancies between theoretical patterns and field measurements and may provide a means of optimizing the radiated field of a surface source or source array in terms of its directivity and the partitioning of energy between various wave types.",10.1190/1.1441750
"Mapping Reservoirs Based On Resistivity And Induced Polarization Derived From Continuous 3D Magnetotelluric Profiling: Case Study From Qaidam Basin, China","In Sanfu, Qaidam basin, China, traditional geophysical methods have failed to find subtle hydrocarbon reservoirs. In an attempt to predict and delineate gas reservoirs, we used a type of magnetotelluric (MT) profiling called 3D continuous electromagnetic profiling (CEMP). Electric logs indicate that gas-bearing formations have high resistivity relative to nongas-bearing formations. Obvious resistivity anomalies derived from MT sounding curves are interpreted to come from gas-bearing formations; we observed no such anomalous resistivity away from gas-bearing reservoirs. For CEMP, five electric components were recorded at each station; the inline electric components of all stations were measured using dipoles placed end to end. Becausethe survey area was quite wide, we divided it into three rectangular blocks for data processing and inversion. After noise removal and static corrections, the data from each block were inverted with a 3D nonlinear conjugate-gradient inversion method to obtain the spatial distribution of resistivity. Using this resistivity, we created a 2D model, which we inverted to determine the induced polarization (IP) parameters. We found that a high-resistivity anomaly and high IP anomaly are two key indicators when predicting and delineating the location of gas-bearing reservoirs. In our case study, a known gas-bearing formation had a high-resistivity anomaly and a high IP anomaly. We identified two similar anomalous regions outside the known gas-bearing formations. As a result, two new prospects were determined as targets worth drilling.",10.1190/1.3279125
"Interpretation Of Geophysical Profiles Between Singapore And Labuan, North Borneo","An interpretation is given of an airborne magnetometer profile from Singapore to Labuan, North Borneo, coupled with a gravity profile which partially covered the same path. The interpretation indicates a shallow basement along the western half of the profile, except for a minor sedimentary basin about 50 miles west of the Tambelan Islands, and another minor sedimentary basin in western Borneo. East of Kuching, Sarawak, the geophysical profiles apparently impinge on a major basin, with sedimentary thickness of the order of 10,000 ft.",10.1190/1.1439278
Water Reverberations—Their Nature And Elimination,"In offshore shooting the validity of previously recorded seismic data has been severely limited by multiple reflections within the water layer. The magnitude of this problem is dependent on the thickness and the nature of the boundaries of the water layer. The effect of the water layer is treated as a linear filtering mechanism, and it is suggested that most apparent water reverberation records probably contain some approximate subsurface structural information, even in their present form. The use of inverse filtering techniques for the removal or attenuation of the water reverberation effect is discussed. Examples show the application of the technique to conventional magnetically recorded offshore data. It has been found that the effectiveness of the method is strongly dependent on the instrumental parameters used in the recording of the original data.",10.1190/1.1438579
Nonlinear One‐Dimensional Seismic Waveform Inversion Using Simulated Annealing,"The seismic inverse problem involves finding a model m that either minimizes the error energy between the data and theoretical seismograms or maximizes the cross‐correlation between the synthetics and the observations. We are, however, faced with two problems: (1) the model space is very large, typically of the order of 5050; and, (2) the error energy function is multimodal. Existing calculus‐based methods are local in scope and easily get trapped in local minima of the energy function. Other methods such as ""simulated annealing"" and ""genetic algorithms"" can be applied to such global optimization problems and they do not depend on the starting model. Both of these methods bear analogy to natural systems and are robust in nature. For example, simulated annealing is the analog to a physical process in which a solid in a ""heat bath"" is heated by increasing the temperature, followed by slow cooling until it reaches the global minimum energy state where it forms a crystal. To use simulated annealing efficiently for 1-D seismic waveform inversion, we require a modeling method that rapidly performs the forward modeling calculation and a cooling schedule that will enable us to find the global minimum of the energy function rapidly. With the advent of vector computers, the reflectivity method has proved successful and the time of the calculation can be reduced substantially if only plane‐wave seismograms are required. Thus, the principal problem with simulated annealing is to find the critical temperature, i.e., the temperature at which crystallization occurs. By initiating the simulated annealing process with different starting temperatures for a fixed number of iterations with a very slow cooling, we noticed that by starting very near but just above the critical temperature, we reach very close to the global minimum energy state very rapidly. We have applied this technique successfully to band‐limited synthetic data in the presence of random noise. In most cases we find that we are able to obtain very good solutions using only a few plane wave seismograms.",10.1190/1.1442973
Approximate Fréchet Derivatives In Inductive Electromagnetic Soundings,"Fréchet derivatives play dual roles in electromagnetic (EM) methods as averaging functions relating conductivity to EM fields and as sensitivity functions relating conductivity perturbations to changes in these fields. For one‐dimensional EM inductive sounding, the Fréchet derivatives are not strongly model‐dependent, even for quite diverse earth models. In fact, using a scaled version of the Fréchet derivative for a uniform half‐space to approximate the exact Jacobian in a layered earth inversion program can actually improve the convergence to an acceptable model. This lack of a strong model dependence makes it possible to consider the capabilities and limitations of EM ""imaging"" methods from the perspective of Fréchet derivatives. Of particular interest is that noninductive Fréchet derivatives are strongly model‐dependent and hence the EM fields generated by this mode are less amenable to imaging techniques.",10.1190/1.1442810

Estimation Of Primaries And Near-Offset Reconstruction By Sparse Inversion: Marine Data Applications,"Most wave-equation-based multiple removal algorithms are based on prediction and subtraction of multiples. Especially for shallow water, the prediction strongly relies on a correct interpolation of the missing near offsets. The subtraction of predicted multiples from the data can easily lead to the distortion of primaries if primaries and multiples overlap. Recently, a new approach for surface-related multiple removal was proposed: the estimation of primaries by sparse inversion (EPSI), which is based on a full waveform inversion approach. EPSI is based on the same primary-multiple model as surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) and does not require a subsurface model. In contrast to SRME, EPSI estimates the primaries as unknowns in a multidimensional inversion process rather than a subtraction process.The multidimensional primary impulse responses are parameterized by band-limited spikes, which are estimated such that they, along with their corresponding multiples, match the input data. An interesting aspect of the EPSI method is that it produces a residual, which is the part of the input data not explained by primaries and multiples. This residual can be analyzed and may provide useful information on the primary estimation process. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that EPSI is also capable of reconstructing the missing near offsets from the multiples. The proposed method is applied to a field data set with moderate water depth, where it is demonstrated that the results are comparable with SRME. This data set is used to illustrate the residual. For a shallow-water field data set, it is shown that EPSI gives a better result than the standard SRME result caused by EPSI's capability to reconstruct the missing near offsets.",10.1190/1.3213532
"Mt And Reflection Seismics In Northwestern Skellefte Ore District, Sweden","A seismic reflection and MT survey was carried out along a 27-km long transect in northwestern Skellefte District, as part of a bigger 3D modeling project. The main motivation for the data acquisition is to elucidate the geologic relationship between the known mineralizations in the Adak mining camp to the north and in the well studied Kristineberg area south of the transect. The seismic reflection data were acquired with a VIBSIST system, and show reflectivity down to 3 s. Apart from the conventional processing for crystalline environments, the seismic data was also subject to an azimuthal binning procedure and cross-dip analysis, allowing the orientation of planar reflectors in 3D. Regarding the MT data, it is primarily of good quality along the 17 installed sites. The inversion of the determinant of the impedance tensor yielded a stable 2D resistivity model, dominated by resistors corresponding to the postorogenic intrusions along the transect. Adding the location of the analyzed seismic reflectors in the MT inversion rendered an integrated model that facilitated a preliminary joint interpretation of the data sets. Overall, the results are in good agreement with surface observations and reveal a crude configuration of the geologic units below the transect. The most prominent outcomes are the lateral and depth extent of the large postorogenic intrusions in the area reaching to 5- or 6-km depth, the dimensions of the nearly vertical Brännäs gabbro extending to 6-km depth, and the presence of enhanced conductivities along the transect at about 10 km depth. The latter is probably related to the deep conductor previously identified in the district.",10.1190/geo2012-0169.1
"Prestack And Poststack Migration Of Crooked-Line Seismic Reflection Data: A Case Study From The South Portuguese Zone Fold Belt, Southwestern Iberia","Crooked-line 2D seismic reflection survey geometries violate underlying assumptions of 2D imaging routines, affecting our ability to resolve the subsurface reliably. We compare three crooked-line imaging schemes involving prestack and poststack time migration using the 2D IBERSEIS deep seismic reflection profile running over the South Portuguese Zone thrust-and-fold belt to obtain crisp high-resolution images of the shallow crust. The crust is characterized by a complex subsurface geometry with conflicting dips of up to   50°  . In summary, the three schemes are (1) normal-moveout (NMO) corrections, dip-moveout (DMO) corrections, common-midpoint (CMP) stacking, CMP projection, and poststack time migration; (2) NMO corrections, DMO corrections, CMP projection, zero-offset time migration of the common-offset gathers, and CMP stacking; (3) CMP projection, prestack time migration in the common-offset domain, and CMP stacking. An essential element of all three schemes is a CMP projection routine, projecting the CMPs first binned along individual segments for preprocessing onto one straight line, which is parallel to the general dip direction of the subsurface structures. After CMP projection, the data satisfy the straight-line assumption of 2D imaging routines more closely. We observe that the prestack time-migration scheme yields comparable or more coherent synthetic and field-data images than the other two DMO-based schemes along the parts of the profile where the acquisition overall follows a straight line. However, the schemes involving DMO corrections are less plagued by migration artifacts than the prestack time-migration scheme along profile parts where the acquisition line is crooked. In particular, prominent migration artifacts on the prestack migrated synthetic data can be related to significant variations in source-receiver azimuths for which 2D prestack migration cannot account. Thus, the processing scheme including DMO corrections, CMP projection, and zero-offset migration of common-offset gathers offers a reliable and effective alternative to prestack migration for crooked-line 2D seismic reflection processing.",10.1190/1.2407267
Modeling Of A Constant Q: Methodology And Algorithm For An Efficient And Optimally Inexpensive Viscoelastic Technique,"Linear anelastic phenomena in wave propagation problems can be well modeled through a viscoelastic mechanical model consisting of standard linear solids. In this paper we present a method for modeling of constant Q as a function of frequency based on an explicit closed formula for calculation of the parameter fields. Several standard linear solids connected in parallel can be tuned through a single parameter to yield an excellent constant Q approximation. The proposed method enables substantial savings in computations and memory requirements. Experiments show that the new method also yields higher accuracy in the modeling of Q than, e.g., the Padé approximant method.",10.1190/1.1443744
Seismic And Gravity Studies At The South Pole,"Results of a seismic and gravity study at the South Pole during the 1961–62 austral summer are presented. Seismic compressional waves in the ice at the South Pole are shown to reach a maximum velocity of 3,925 m/sec at a depth of 186 m. This depth is attributed to the density profile of the ice. An ice thickness of 2,900 m is indicated from seismic reflection shooting. Gravity data reveal flat topography underlying the ice in the vicinity of the South Pole.",10.1190/1.1439232
Focusing Aspects Of The Parabolic Radon Transform,"From a geometrical point of view, the parabolic Radon transform of a common shotpoint gather is a focusing technique where the ""focal length"" is determined by the velocity field. When the traveltime curves at small offset are approximated by hyperbolas, the reciprocal of the curvature of an ""image"" is related to the square of the curvature at zero offset of the corresponding traveltime curve. Each event on a common‐shotpoint gather will be separated by the parabolic Radon transform, and the position of the foci associated with peg‐leg multiples can be predicted. Examples on synthetic common‐shotpoint gathers illustrate the merits of the analysis.",10.1190/1.1444466
Model Reliability For 3D Electrical Resistivity Tomography: Application Of The Volume Of Investigation Index To A Time-Lapse Monitoring Experiment,"Solution appraisal is difficult for large 3D, nonlinear inverse problems such as electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). We construct the volume of investigation index (VOI) as the sensitivity of the inversion result to a variable-reference model. This limited exploration of the model space provides an efficient and pragmatic method of appraisal for a particular data set and a 3D model domain. We present a synthetic example to demonstrate the applicability of the VOI as a tool for characterizing model reliability for 3D ERT and as a method of survey design. We show how the VOI provides a measure of model resolution and how insight gained from VOI analysis cannot be gained through similar examination of the average sensitivity distributions. In the context of ERT monitoring of an injection/withdrawal experiment, we utilize the VOI for judging the degree of reliability of hydrogeological interpretations that stem from features observed in the estimated electrical-conductivity models. We employ the VOI for the experimental data as a comparative measure of survey performance. For this experiment, the VOI shows that a larger, more artifact-free region of reliability is achieved using a circulating vertical dipole-dipole survey geometry, as opposed to a horizontal dipole-dipole survey geometry. The experimental VOI distributions exhibit dependence on the borehole infrastructure and the actual earth model.",10.1190/1.2732550
Randomized Sampling And Sparsity: Getting More Information From Fewer Samples,"Many seismic exploration techniques rely on the collection of massive data volumes that are subsequently mined for information during processing. Although this approach has been extremely successful in the past, current efforts toward higher-resolution images in increasingly complicated regions of the earth continue to reveal fundamental shortcomings in our workflows. Chiefly among these is the so-called ""curse of dimensionality"" exemplified by Nyquist's sampling criterion, which disproportionately strains current acquisition and processing systems as the size and desired resolution of our survey areas continue to increase. We offer an alternative sampling method leveraging recent insights from compressive sensing toward seismic acquisition and processing for data that are traditionally considered to be undersampled. The main outcome of this approach is a new technology where acquisition and processing related costs are no longer determined by overly stringent sampling criteria, such asNyquist. At the heart of our approach lies randomized incoherent sampling that breaks subsampling related interferences by turning them into harmless noise, which we subsequently remove by promoting transform-domain sparsity. Now, costs no longer grow significantly with resolution and dimensionality of the survey area, but instead depend only on transform-domain sparsity. Our contribution is twofold. First, we demonstrate by means of carefully designed numerical experiments that compressive sensing can successfully be adapted to seismic exploration. Second, we show that accurate recovery can be accomplished for compressively sampled data volumes sizes that exceed the size of conventional transform-domain data volumes by only a small factor. Because compressive sensing combines transformation and encoding by a single linear encoding step, this technology is directly applicable to acquisition and to dimensionality reduction during processing. In either case, sampling, storage, and processing costs scale with transform-domain sparsity. We illustrate this principle by means of number of case studies.",10.1190/1.3506147
Gravity Surveys In Heavy Sand Dunes,"The paper discusses the problems involved in desert surveys under the headings of ""Access"" and ""Correction of Gravity Data."" The types of sand formation are described. In planning a survey the importance of reconnaissance, aerial photographs, and the provision of suitable equipment are stressed. The advantages and disadvantages of motor transport, light aircraft, helicopters, and the operational procedures used with each are discussed. Terrain corrections are necessary on most stations and suggestions are given for their determination. The different densities of the dune sand and the ""floor"" introduce a problem in the determination of the Bouguer Correction. A method is given whereby close estimates of the sand thickness can be found by contouring on the ""floor"" or on minimum elevations. The resulting Bouguer values after computation are as regular as those found in areas of small elevational changes.",10.1190/1.1438903
Estimation Of Depth To The Bottom Of Magnetic Sources By A Modified Centroid Method For Fractal Distribution Of Sources: An Application To Aeromagnetic Data In Germany,"We propose a modified centroid method to compute the depth to the bottom of magnetic sources (DBMS) based on a fractal source distribution. This approach provides better estimates than the assumption of an uncorrelated source distribution. We apply our approach to a recently compiled homogeneous set of aeromagnetic data from Germany. The deepest DBMS values are found for some large basin areas, i.e., the Molasse basin and parts of the North German basin. Smaller DBMS were estimated for the Moldanubian region in southern Germany and the northern part of the North German basin. A comparison of DBMS with heat-flow data, crustal temperatures at 3-km depths, and Moho depth indicates that DBMS is controlled by the geothermal condition of the earth's crust in Germany and lithologic changes. Although the Upper Rhine graben and the Moldanubian region are characterized by small DBMS, a change in DBMS values in northern Germany seems to be related to the Elbe lineament.",10.1190/1.3560017
"Kimberlite Exploration At Serra Da Canastra Province, Brazil","Kimberlite and lamproite pipes are the only economically significant source rocks forming primary diamond deposits. Brazil, the world's seventh largest diamond producer, has all of its production from alluvial deposits. The quest for a primary deposit has continued over several decades with very few positive results. To that end, airborne magnetic data from the Serra da Canastra diamondiferous province was used to identify kimberlite signatures. Serra da Canastra is located in the central portion of the Brazilian province in a low-magnetic-latitude region. The main tectonic feature of the area is a northwest-southeast major crustal fracture zone that extends for more than   3000 km   within the territory. The interpretation strategy was based on joint analysis of analytic signal and Euler deconvolution. A selected kimberlite target should typically have a roughly circular analytic signal anomaly coincident with a depth    (0–200 m)    and structural   (N=2)   constrained Euler solution. The proposed approach led to recognition of previously known pipes and generation of new targets. Ground geologic, geophysical, and geochemical follow-up surveys are necessary to test these selected targets.",10.1190/1.2710352
Electric Potential Near A Spherical Body In A Conducting Half‐Space,"An extensive summary of classical potential solutions has been given recently by Van Nostrand and Cook (1966). This note presents a solution for the potential due to a point source of electric current placed on the earth's surface in the vicinity of a buried spherical body of arbitrary resistivity. The analysis follows the procedure suggested by Van Nostrand and Cook and is similar to that used recently by Merkel (1969, 1971).",10.1190/1.1440212
Natural Recession Of The Eastern Margin Of The Leofnard Salt In Western Canada,"The Lloydminster area (T35-65, R15W3M-10W4M) of east‐central Alberta and west‐central Saskatchewan, Canada, is dissected by the north‐northwest trending updip active dissolution margin, of the Devonian Leofnard Member rock salt. West of this margin, up to 150 m of rock salt is preserved; updip and to the east, the salt has mostly been leached from the rock record. The margin is up to 40 km wide and characterized by extreme local variations in net salt thickness. The dissolution of the Leofnard rock salt in the Lloydminster area has resulted in the entrapment of significant hydrocarbon accumulation. Stratigraphic traps, for example, have formed where reservoir facies were either preferentially deposited or preserved in salt‐dissolution lows. Structural traps, in contrast, have formed where reservoir facies are draped across residual salt or collapse features. It has been estimated that three trillion barrels of oil (mostly of high viscosity and unrecoverable) are entrapped along the eastern dissolution margin of the Leofnard rock salt in western Canada. A record of the westward progression of the dissolutional edge of the Leofnard salt is locked in the stratigraphic column. This progression is recorded as localized interval thickening in areas where dissolution and deposition were contemporaneous. The horizontal positioning of these interval thicks as a function of their geologic age provides a time record for the positioning of the salt edge. To further explain the process of salt dissolution in the Lloydminster area, we present a suite of contour maps, geologic cross‐sections, and seismic profiles. These data depict the present‐day distribution of the Leofnard salt in the Lloydminster study area. They support the theses that: (1) the dissolution margin of the Leofnard rock salt originated along the Elk Point outcrop to the east of the study area during the pre‐Cretaceous; and (2) the margin receded into the northeastern part of the Lloydminster study area during earliest Cretaceous or pre‐Cretaceous time and migrated progressively thereafter into its current position. From the perspective of the explorationist, such information is important because it identifies prospective play areas with high potential for the formation of salt‐related stratigraphic traps and/or structural traps.",10.1190/1.1443943
Avo Modeling And The Locally Converted Shear Wave,"The locally converted shear wave is often neglected in ray‐trace modeling when reproduction of the AVO response of potential hydrocarbon reservoirs is attempted. Primaries‐only ray‐trace modeling in which the Zoeppritz equations describe the reflection amplitudes is most common. The locally converted shear waves, however, often have a first‐order effect on the seismic response. This fact does not appear to be widely recognized, or else the implications are not well understood. Primaries‐only Zoeppritz modeling can be very misleading. Interference between the converted waves and the primary reflections from the base of the layers becomes increasingly important as layer thicknesses decrease. This interference often produces a seismogram that is very different from one produced under the primaries‐only Zoeppritz assumption. For primaries‐only modeling of thin layers, synthetic seismograms obtained by use of a linearized approximation to the Zoeppritz equations to describe the reflection coefficients are more accurate than those obtained by use of the exact Zoeppritz reflection coefficients. A real‐data example consisting of an assemblage of very thin layers has recently been discussed in the literature. Inferences as to the true earth properties based on the predicted amplitude variation with offset are in error because the primaries‐only assumption is invalid. For one of the models, primaries‐only modeling predicts an amplitude increase of approximately a factor of three from the near trace to the far trace. Reflectivity modeling predicts an amplitude decrease with offset. The O'Doherty‐Anstey effect suggests that transmission loss for primary reflections should not be included in normal‐incidence synthetic seismograms if the short‐period reverberations are not also included. The same principle holds for prestack modeling. Similarly, the Zoeppritz equations should not be used for synthetic seismograms without including the locally converted shear wave.",10.1190/1.1443681
Flexibly Preconditioned Extended Least-Squares Migration In Shot-Record Domain,"We have developed a method for accelerating the convergence of iterative least-squares migration. The algorithm uses a pseudodifferential scaling (dip and spatially varying filter) preconditioner together with a variant of conjugate gradient (CG) iteration with iterate-dependent (flexible) preconditioning. The migration is formulated without the image stack, thus producing a shot-dependent image volume that retains offset information useful for velocity updating and amplitude variation with offset analysis. Numerical experiments indicate that flexible preconditioning with pseudodifferential scaling not only attains considerably smaller data misfit and gradient error for a given computational effort, but also produces higher resolution image volumes with more balanced amplitude and fewer artifacts than is achieved with a nonpreconditioned CG method.",10.1190/geo2016-0023.1
Stabilization Of Bottom‐Hole Temperature In The Presence Of Formation Fluid Flows,"Reliable estimates of bottom‐hole temperature (BHT) in oil wells are of considerable interest in reservoir engineering problems as well as in geothermal research. Because BHT measurements are usually made soon after drilling, true formation temperature can be obtained only by correcting for the effects of drilling disturbances. The magnitude of drilling disturbance depends upon duration of drilling, time elapsed after stoppage of drilling, well characteristics, thermal properties of drilling fluid, and the nature of heat exchange between the well and the formation.",10.1190/1.1442099
Rational Interpolation Of Qp-Traveltimes For Semblance-Based Anisotropy Estimation In Layered Vti Media,"The   τ-p   domain is the natural domain for anisotropy parameter estimation in horizontally layered media. The need to transform the data to the   τ-p   domain or to pick traveltimes in the   t-x   domain is, however, a practical disadvantage. To overcome this, we combine   τ-p  -derived traveltimes and offsets in horizontally layered transversely isotropic media with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI) with a rational interpolation procedure applied in the   t-x   domain. This combination results in an accurate and efficient   t-x  -based semblance analysis for anisotropy parameter estimation from the moveout of qP-waves in horizontally layered VTI media. The semblance analysis is applied to the moveout to search directly for the interval values of the relevant parameters. To achieve this, the method is applied in a layer-stripping fashion. We demonstrate the method using synthetic data examples and show that it is robust in the presence of random noise and moderate statics.",10.1190/1.2938036
Electromagnetic Scattering From Cylinders Of Arbitrary Cross‐Section In A Conductive Half‐Space,"A general numerical technique is presented for solving the problem of electromagnetic scattering by conducting cylinders of arbitrary cross‐section located in a conductive half‐space. Solutions to the electromagnetic wave equation are required for the free space above the half‐space, for the half‐space surrounding the cylinder, and for the cylinder. The problem is formulated by choosing an integral representation for the electromagnetic fields in each of the three homogeneous regions. By enforcing the boundary conditions on tangential E and H, we obtain a set of coupled integral equations which can be solved numerically for the unknown equivalent surface current densities on the interface bounding each homogeneous region. Once these current densities have been estimated, the fields can be calculated at any point from the general integral representations. The following conclusions are among those of importance to AFMAG and VLF surveys: 1) the ratio of Re (H) to Im (H) is a function of traverse position and of ground conductivity, as well as of cylinder conductivity and of survey frequency; 2) in no case was a zero phase observed, even for perfectly conducting cylinders; and 3) reverse crossovers in Im (H) can occur in the field scattered by a single conductor whenever the radius of curvature on the upper portion of a ""poor"" conductor is small.",10.1190/1.1440165

Petrophysical Seismic Inversion Conditioned To Well-Log Data: Methods And Application To A Gas Reservoir,"Hydrocarbon reservoirs are characterized by seismic, well-log, and petrophysical information, which is dissimilar in spatial distribution, scale, and relationship to reservoir properties. We combine this diverse information in a unified inverse-problem formulation using a multiproperty, multiscale model, linking properties statistically by petrophysical relationships and conditioning them to well-log data. Two approaches help us: (1) Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling, which generates many reservoir realizations for estimating medium properties and posterior marginal probabilities, and (2) optimization with a least-squares iterative technique to obtain the most probable model configuration. Our petrophysical model, applied to near-vertical-anglestackedseismic data and well-log data from a gas reservoir, includes a deterministic component, based on a combination of Wyllie and Wood relationships calibrated with the well-log data, and a random component, based on the statistical characterization of the deviations of well-log data from the petrophysical transform. At the petrophysical level, the effects of porosity and saturation on acoustic impedance are coupled; conditioning the inversion to well-log data helps resolve this ambiguity. The combination of well logs, petrophysics, and seismic inversion builds on the corresponding strengths of each type of information, jointly improving (1) cross resolution of reservoir properties, (2) vertical resolution of property fields, (3) compliance to the smooth trend of property fields, and (4) agreement with well-log data at well positions.",10.1190/1.3043796
Polarity Coincidence Scheme For Revealing Signal Coherence,"A simple statistical procedure, based on multiple coincidence of field polarities as indicated by several receptors, offers a criterion of the existence of a signal below the general noise level. As an example, with six receptors in a field where there is a sine wave signal ten decibels below the noise level, there will be twice the number of coincidences that would be obtained for the noise alone. A scheme is shown to illustrate how an electrical system can perform the analysis and present the results continuously.",10.1190/1.1438388
3-D Seismic Reflection Tomography On Top Of The Gocad Depth Modeler,"The estimation of velocity macro‐models by seismic reflection tomography is studied in three‐dimensions. Inversion techniques based on the kinematics of seismic data require an appropriate parameterization of the geological macro‐model, in particular as far as the velocity field is concerned. The step toward structurally complex geological models is achieved by exploiting a new approach to 3-D depth modeling: GOCAD. The peculiarities inherent to GOCAD triangulated surfaces and its associated discrete smooth interpolator (DSI) have led to the development of original ray‐tracing techniques. By exploiting intensively the topology of the triangulated surfaces, these new algorithms make it possible to reach a good balance between accuracy and computation performance. To build a 3-D macro‐model estimation tool, ray‐tracing is then associated with a least‐squares inversion of depth parameters and velocity parameters from 3-D zero‐offset traveltimes and stacking velocities, or multi‐offset prestack traveltimes from 2-D seismic lines.",10.1190/1.1444075
Shallow-Structure Characterization By 2D Elastic Full-Waveform Inversion,"Assessing the effectiveness of elastic full-waveform-inversion (FWI) algorithms when applied to shallow 2D structures in the presence of a complex topography is critically important. By using FWI, we overcome inherent limitations of conventional seismic methods used for near-surface prospecting (acoustic tomography and multichannel spectral analysis of surface waves). The elastic forward problem, formulated in the frequency domain, is based on a mixed finite-element P0-P1 discontinuous Galerkin method to ensure accurate modeling of complex topography effects at a reasonable computing cost. The inversion problem uses an FWI algorithm to minimize the misfit between observed and calculated data. Based on results from a numerical experiment performed on a realistic landslide model inspired from the morphostructure of the Super-Sauze earthflow, we analyzed the effect of using a hierarchical preconditioning strategy, based on a simultaneous multifrequency inversion of damped data, to mitigate the strong nonlinearities coming from the surface waves. This strategy is a key point in alleviating the strong near-surface effects and avoiding convergence toward a local minimum. Using a limited-memory quasi-Newton method improved the convergence level. These findings are analogous to recent applications on large-scale domains, although limited source-receiver offset ranges, low-frequency content of the source, and domination of surface waves on the signal led to some difficulties. Regarding the impact of data decimation on the inversion results, we have learned that an inversion restricted to the vertical data component can be successful without significant loss in terms of parameter imagery resolution. In our investigations of the effect of increased source spacing, we found that a sampling of 4 m (less than three times the theoretical maximum of one half-wavelength) led to severe aliasing.",10.1190/1.3569798
Topographic Migration Of Georadar Data: Implications For Acquisition And Processing,"Application of conventional elevation static corrections and migration to wavefield data recorded on irregular surfaces may result in poor reconstructions of complex subsurface features. Particulary poor images may be obtained at locations where the depths to target structures are comparable to undulations in the surface topography. For example, topographic relief of only 1-2 m may be important for the processing of georadar data. We describe an algorithm that allows georadar data to be migrated directly from gently to highly irregular acquisition surfaces. When applied to a variety of complicated synthetic data sets, topographically migrated images are observed to be markedly superior to those produced by two standard processing schemes. Extensive tests demonstrate that topographic migration should be considered in regions characterized by surface gradients ≫10% (i.e., dips ≫6°). For effective topographic migration, lateral and vertical coordinates of the georadar antennas should be determined to better than 10% of the dominant georadar wavelength, and velocities should be known to within 10–20% (e.g., 0.01–0.02 m/ns) of their true values. When applied to data collected across a moderately dipping (∼14°) rock glacier in the Swiss Alps, georadar sections resulting from two standard processing schemes have reflectors with depths and dips that differ by a significant 10–15% from those in the topographically migrated images.",10.1190/1.1444781
Long‐Wave Elastic Anisotropy In Transversely Isotropic Media,"Compressional waves in horizontally layered media exhibit very weak long‐wave anisotropy for short offset seismic data within the physically relevant range of parameters. Shear waves have much stronger anisotropic behavior. Our results generalize the analogous results of Krey and Helbig (1956) in several respects: (1) The inequality (c11-c44)(c33-c44)⩾(c13+c44)2 derived by Postma (1955) for periodic isotropic, two‐layered media is shown to be valid for any homogeneous, transversely isotropic medium; (2) a general perturbation scheme for analyzing the angular dependence of the phase velocity is formulated and readily yields Krey and Helbig's results in limiting cases; and (3) the effects of relaxing the assumption of constant Poisson's ratio σ are considered. The phase and group velocities for all three modes of elastic wave propagation are illustrated for typical layered media with (1) one‐quarter limestone and three‐quarters sandstone, (2) half‐limestone and half‐sandstone, and (3) three‐quarters limestone and one‐quarter sandstone. It is concluded that anisotropic effects are greatest in areas where the layering is quite thin (10–50 ft), so that the wavelengths of the seismic signal are greater than the layer thickness and the layers are of alternately high‐ and low‐velocity materials.",10.1190/1.1440984
High-Amplitude Noise Detection By The Expectation-Maximization Algorithm With Application To Swell-Noise Attenuation,"High-amplitude noise is a common problem in seismic data. Current filtering techniques that target this problem first detect the location of the noise and then remove it by damping or interpolation. Detection is done conventionally by comparing individual data amplitudes in a certain domain to a user-controlled local threshold. In practice, the threshold is optimally tuned by trial and error and is often changed to match the varying noise power across the data set. We have developed an automatic method to compute the appropriate threshold for high-amplitude noise detection and attenuation. The main idea is to exploit differences in statistical properties between noise and signal amplitudes to construct a detection criterion. A model that consists of a mixtureof two statistical distributions, representing the signal and the noise, is fitted to the data. Then it is used to estimate the probability (i.e., likelihood) that each sample in the data is noisy by means of an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Only those samples with a likelihood greater than a specific threshold are considered to be noise. The resulting probability threshold is better adapted to the data compared to a conventional amplitude threshold. It offers the user, through the probability threshold value, the possibility to quantify the confidence in whether a large amplitude anomaly is considered as noise. The method is generic; however, our work develops and implements the method for swell-noise attenuation. Initial results are encouraging, showing slightly better performance than an optimized conventional method but with much less parameter testing and variation.",10.1190/1.3428749
Fundamentals Of Seismic Rock Physics,"During the past 50 years or so, tremendous progress has been made in studying physical properties of rocks and minerals in relation to seismic exploration and earthquake seismology. During this period, many theories have been developed and many experiments have been carried out. Some of these theories and experimental results have played important roles in advancing earth sciences and exploration technologies. This tutorial paper attempts to summarize some of these results.",10.1190/1.1444931
Estimating Rock Porosity And Fluid Saturation Using Only Seismic Velocities,"Evaluation of the fluid content in deep earth reservoirs or fluid contaminants in shallow earth environments has required the use of geophysical imaging methods such as seismic reflection prospecting. Interpretation of seismic velocities and amplitudes is based on theories of fluid‐saturated and partially saturated rocks that have been available since the 1950s. Here we present a new synthesis of the same physical concepts that uses compressional‐wave velocities together with shear‐wave velocities in a scheme that is much simpler to understand and apply yet yields detailed information about porosity and fluid saturation magnitudes and spatial distribution. The key idea revolves around the fact that the density and the Lamé elastic parameter λ are the only two parameters determining seismic velocities that also contain information about fluid saturation. At low enough frequencies, Gassmann's well‐known equations show that the shear modulus is independent of the fluid saturation level. We use these facts to construct saturation‐proxy and data‐sorting plots from seismic velocity data. The new method does not require reflectivity data, although it can use such information if available. The method can therefore be applied to a wide range of source–receiver configurations, including seismic reflection profiling (surface to surface), vertical seismic profiling (well to surface), and cross‐well seismic transmission tomography (well to well), since availability of reflection data is not a requirement.",10.1190/1.1468599
Limitations Of The Reflection Seismic Method; Lessons From Computer Simulations,"Piece‐wise local linearity of the subsurface reflectors and uniqueness of primary reflection travel path between particular source‐receiver pairs are two of the fundamental assumptions of multiple ground coverage reflection seismic techniques as currently employed. Some recent developments in seismic exploration which spring from the progress made in velocity determination techniques violate these fundamental assumptions with potentially serious consequences such as spurious geometries after migration and unrealistic interval velocities. In this paper we apply analytic techniques and computer simulation to linear and nonlinear subsurface models in order to obtain better definitions of the limitations of the reflection seismic method. The resulting lessons are of immediate practical value in seismic interpretation and clarify a variety of commonly occurring but puzzling situations such as phantom faults, incomplete contacts and segmented reflectors at unconformities, and apparent reversal of dip. In its basic approach this work has much in common with the generation and study of synthetic seismograms. Examination of the groundwork of the seismic method provides a firm base for extending its use.",10.1190/1.1440115
A One-Way Dual-Domain Propagator For Scalar Qp-Waves In Vti Media,"In this paper, we present an anisotropic one-way propagator for modeling and imaging quasi-P (qP) waves in transversely isotropic media with a vertically symmetric axis (VTI media). We derive the dispersion relation for a scalar qP-wave using elastic wave equations for anisotropic media. By applying a rational approximation to the dispersion relation, we obtain a one-way, dual-domain, scalar qP-wave propagator for heterogeneous VTI media. The propagator includes a phase-shift term and both phase-screen and large-angle correction terms. The phase-shift term is implemented in the wavenumber domain, while the other terms are implemented in the space domain. Fourier transformations are used to shuttle the wavefield between the two domains. This propagator can be used to propagate qP-wavefields within an isotropic or a VTI medium, with either medium containing lateral heterogeneities. Error analysis of the impulse response and dispersion relations demonstrates that the propagator is accurate and stable and has a wide-angle capability. The application of the propagator to the imaging of qP-wave data with VTI models which contain complex structures and large perturbations of velocity and anisotropy results in excellent image quality. This demonstrates the potential value of the propagator for use in modeling and imaging qP-wavefields within strongly heterogeneous VTI media.",10.1190/1.1884826
A Geophone Subarray Beam‐Steering Process,"The outputs of geophone array elements are conventionally summed into a single output trace. This summation attenuates incoherent noise, horizontally propagating surface waves, and obliquely incident events. The geophone subarray beam‐steering process is a plane‐wave stacking technique which removes the differential moveout and improves the resolution of seismic data by directing the subarray peak gain to the incident angle of the seismic wavefront. The plane‐wave stacking process transforms the data from the offset domain to the ray parameter (p) domain, and restricts the range of p as a function of time. Studies of synthetic and marine field data show that the beam‐steering process improves the signal‐to‐noise ratio of obliquely incident events as compared to conventional subarray summing operations. The beam‐steering process, compressing high‐density data while preserving the high‐frequency content of the seismic signal, is a cost‐effective technique to process large quantities of closely spaced seismic data for stratigraphic exploration.",10.1190/1.1441597
Detection Of Reflections On Seismic Records By Linear Operators,"Linear operators are used as a statistical tool in the analysis of seismic records. It was found that when an operator is chosen for a non‐reflection interval and applied to regions during which reflections occur, the effectiveness of the operator is disturbed and large errors of prediction result. This effect provides a method for the discrimination of reflections. The technique used has its basis in the theory of time series, relevant concepts of which are reviewed. The mechanics of application are given, and illustrative examples on ten seismograms are presented.",10.1190/1.1437911
"Low‐Cost Geophysical Investigations Of A Paleochannel Aquifer In The Eastern Goldfields, Western Australia","Compressional (P) wave and shear (S) wave seismic reflection techniques were used to delineate the sand and gravel aquifer within a highly saline clay‐filled paleochannel in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. The seismic refraction and gravity methods were also used to investigate the paleochannel. The unsaturated loose fine‐grained sand up to 10 m in depth at the surface is a major factor in degrading subsurface imaging. The seismic processing needed to be precise, with accurate static corrections and normal moveout corrections. Deconvolution enhanced the aquifer and other paleochannel reflectors. P‐wave reflection and refraction layer depths had good correlation and showed a total of six boundaries: (1) water table, (2) change in velocity (compaction) in the paleochannel sediments, (3) sand and gravel aquifer, (4) red‐brown saprolite and green saprolite boundary, (5) weathered bedrock, and (6) unweathered bedrock. P‐wave explosive and hammer sources were found to have similar signal characteristics, and the aquifer and bedrock were both imaged using the hammer source. The deep shots below the water table have the most broadband frequency response for reflections, but stacking clear reflections was difficult. The S‐wave reflection results showed high lateral and vertical resolution of the basal saprolite clay, the sand and gravel aquifer, and very shallow clays above the aquifer. The S‐wave reflection stacking velocities were 10–20% of the P‐waves, increasing the resolution of the S‐wave section. The gravity data were modelled to fit the known drilling and P‐wave seismic reflection depths. The refraction results did not identify the top of bedrock, so refraction depths were not used for the gravity modeling in this highly weathered environment. The final gravity model mapped the bedrock topography beyond the lateral extent of the seismic and drilling data.",10.1190/1.1484512
Propagation Of An Electric Pulse Through A Homogeneous And Isotropic Medium,"The paper discusses the propagation of a step‐function pulse in a medium characterized by the three electric constants, permittivity ε, permeability μ and conductivity σ. The effect of the displacement current on the propagation is fully taken into account. Expressions of electric and magnetic fields are determined. It is shown that the time of travel of the pulse and the initial and final values of any one of the non‐vanishing field components (all of which can be measured) fully specify the values of conductivity and permittivity of the medium.",10.1190/1.1438433
Image Registration Guided Wavefield Tomography For Shear-Wave Velocity Model Building,"Multicomponent acquisitions offer the opportunity to form elastic migration images and to estimate elastic parameters of the subsurface. Compared with better constrained P-wave velocity inversions, it is more difficult to estimate the S-wave velocity due to strong nonlinearities introduced by converted S-waves. We have developed an iterative S-wave velocity inversion method guided by image registration. Given an accurate P-wave velocity and a simple initial S-wave model, we form P-P and P-S images using elastic reverse time migration. We use image registration to find the shifts between the P-S and P-P images. The S-wave velocity model could be updated iteratively by minimizing the differences between the original and the fractionally warped P-S images. A simple layered model and a modified Marmousi model are used to demonstrate the viability of the new method. In both examples, high-quality P-S images, as well as smooth S-wave velocity models, are inverted efficiently with a homogeneous S-wave initial model.",10.1190/geo2014-0360.1
The Reflection Of Rayleigh Waves By A High Impedance Obstacle On A Half‐Space,"The reflection of a time‐harmonic Rayleigh wave by a high impedance obstacle in shearless contact with an elastic half‐space of lower impedance is examined theoretically. The potentials are found by a function—theoretic solution to dual integral equations. From these potentials, a ""reflection coefficient"" is defined for the surface vertical displacement in the Rayleigh wave. Results show that the reflected wave is π/2 radians out of phase with the incident wave for arbitrary Poisson's ratio. The modulus of the ""reflection coefficient"" depends upon Poisson's ratio, and is evaluated as rR=0.265 for σ=0.25.",10.1190/1.1438805
Seismic Monitoring Of Water Floods?—A Petrophysical Study,"Seismic velocities were measured in the laboratory on 67 samples as a function of pressure and temperature when saturated with gas and a 35° API = 141.5/(density at 1 atmosphere and 60°F) − 131.5] mineral oil and flooded with pentane and fresh water, respectively, using an ultrasonic pulse transmission method. The rock samples consisted of 39 carbonate cores from eight reservoirs, 22 sandstone cores from six formations, and six unconsolidated samples from three origins. The results show that water flooding increases the compressional velocity Vp by more than 5 percent in most of the gas‐saturated cores at effective pressures (overburden pressure minus pore pressure) less than 20 MPa. Such Vp increase is less than 5 percent in about half of the carbonate cores and some of the sandstone cores with normal pentane and in all the consolidated cores (both carbonates and sandstones) saturated with the 35° API oil. However, in unconsolidated samples saturated with gas, pentane, or oil, water flooding increases the Vp substantially. Both the laboratory results and theoretical analysis show that seismic methods may succeed in monitoring water floods in some reservoirs under certain conditions, while they may fail in others. It is thus important to carry out petrophysical and feasibility studies prior to the implementation of in‐situ seismic monitoring of water‐flood processes.",10.1190/1.1442972
Hyperbolic Traveltime Analysis Of First Arrivals In An Azimuthally Anisotropic Medium: A Physical Modeling Study,"Wave propagation in a fractured medium is modeled physically using layers of Plexiglas with thin films of water, held under moderate uniaxial confining pressure. The system exhibits anisotropy comparable to that of measured earth materials; i.e., shear‐wave splitting to waves with 3 percent velocity differences and P-wave directional anisotropy of at least 20 percent. SV polarizations demonstrate the concept of the shear‐wave window with the conversion of an SV body wave to an internal head wave with P-wave velocity, a head wave which is present in both the fractured medium and the control solid (unfractured) medium. For an azimuthally anisotropic medium, moveout curves are hyperbolic for a surface line oriented parallel to the fractures but are nonhyperbolic for a line oriented perpendicular to the fractures. Q anisotropy is observed in the system, with strongest attenuation on propagation paths perpendicular to the fractures.",10.1190/1.1442825
Estimation Of Distant Relief Effect In Gravimetry,"We analyze gravitational effects of distant topographic and bathymetric relief beyond the (earth-centered) angular distance of   1° 29′ 58″    (i.e., beyond the outer limit of the Hayford-Bowie zone O, or approximately   167 km  ) using a spherical earth model. Our results support current procedures that neglect distant relief effects for most local gravity surveys but show their potential importance for continental- and global-scale surveys. The distant relief can produce horizontal gradients as large as   0.3 E     (0.03 mGal∕km)  . In mountainous areas, the gravitational effect of the distant relief is significant, even for local surveys, although the vertical gradient of the distant relief effect never exceeds   ±30 E     (3 mGal∕km)   on the earth's surface.",10.1190/1.2338333
Discussions And Communications: Status Of The Federal Explosives Act,"Because of recent statements in the press and the elimination of the office of licensing agents, many persons are confused regarding the status of the Federal Explosives Act. This Act is still in full force, and any person violating its provisions is still subject to the penalties provided.",10.1190/1.11010001.1
An Automatic Least‐Squares Multimodel Method For Magnetic Interpretation,"The magnetic anomalies caused by such diverse model shapes as the finite strike length thick dike, the vertical prism, thes loping step, the parallelepiped body, etc., may be obtained through an appropriate numerical integration of the expression for the magnetic effect produced by a finite thin plate. Using models generated in this manner, an automatic computer method has been developed at the Geological Survey of Canada for the interpretation of magnetic data. Because the magnetic anomalies produced by the various model shapes are nonlinear in parameters of shape and position, it is necessary to use an iterative procedure to obtain the values for the various model parameters which yield a least‐squares best‐fit anomaly curve to a set of discrete observed data. The interpretation method described in this paper uses the Powell algorithm for this purpose. The procedure can sometimes be made more efficient using a Marquardt modification to the Powell algorithm. Examples of the use of the method are presented for an elongated anomaly in the Moose River basin of the Hudson Bay lowlands in northern Ontario, and for an areally large elliptical anomaly in the Sverdrup basin of the Canadian Arctic Islands.",10.1190/1.1440345
Performance Of Piezoelectric Transducers In Terms Of Amplitude And Waveform,"For seismic physical modeling, piezoelectric transducers (PETs) usually are used as sources and receivers. Their properties affect data significantly, especially if data are processed as seismic data: (1) Strong resonance at one frequency causes a ringy signal and a narrow frequency band; (2) the pronounced directionality effectively limits the offsets at which energy arrives; and (3) because the dimension of the   12-mm   transducer is larger than the wavelength   (1.5 to 10.0 mm)  , the recorded waveform changes with offset. To reduce the pronounced directionality of the transducers at ultrasonic frequencies, we designed PETs that have a smaller effective diameter than do traditional ones. To test their applicability for laboratory seismic profiling, we tested their frequency sensitivity, their directionality, and the change of waveform as a function of offset caused by their size relative to the wavelengths. The experiments showed that the PETs produce their best-quality data at frequencies of   350 to 550 kHz   and source-receiver offsets of   ≤14 cm  . For these frequencies, the amplitudes decay to ringing-noise level at incidence angles of   35°  ; for a reflector   10 cm   deep, that results in a   14-cm   source-receiver offset. For these frequencies and offsets, the spacious dimension of the PETs does not cause the waveform to change such that further processing is compromised. We also developed an analytic solution to the changing-waveform problem that predicts the temporal divergence of the signal as an additional resolution limit to the Fresnel effect; the loss of high frequencies is caused not by by attenuation alone, but also by the spacious dimension of the sensors.",10.1190/1.3072619
Simultaneous Measurement Of Hysteresis In Capillary Pressure And Electric Permittivity For Multiphase Flow Through Porous Media,"We present a tool that simultaneously measures the complex permittivity and the capillary pressure characteristics for multiphase flow. The sample holder is a parallel plate capacitor. A precision component analyzer is used to measure the impedance amplitude and phase angle as a function of frequency (  1 kHz   to   3 MHz  ). The complex impedance of the (partially) saturated sample is directly related to the effective complex permittivity. We have conducted main drainage and main imbibition cycles for unconsolidated sand-water-gas   ( CO2 ∕ N2 )   systems at 8-bar pressure and at temperatures between   27°C   and   28°C  . Hysteresis in capillary pressure and electric permittivity, as a result of phase distribution, is found between drainage and imbibition for   f=3 MHz   and becomes more pronounced at higher water saturations. Good agreement of the measured electric permittivity with the complex refractive index model indicates that induced polarization is not observed for   3 MHz   and the water saturation is reasonably predicted. The experiments have been performed to study the capillary pressure behavior during    CO2    sequestration.",10.1190/1.2714684
Borehole Flexural Modes In Anisotropic Formations,"A perturbation method of solution is an efficient way of analyzing elastic wave propagation along a borehole in anisotropic formations. The perturbation model allows us to calculate changes in the modal dispersion curves caused by the differences in elastic constants between the anisotropic formation of interest and a reference, or unperturbed, isotropic formation. The equivalent isotropic constants in the reference formation are obtained from the appropriate compressional‐and shear‐wave velocities for the selected propagation and polarization directions of the flexural mode. This choice of the unperturbed solution means that the required perturbation is minimal, resulting in enhanced accuracy of the perturbed solution. Computational results are presented for the dispersion curves of borehole flexural waves in a transversely isotropic (TI) formation as a function of borehole deviation from the TI symmetry axis. In addition, radial distributions of displacement and stress fields associated with the flexural wave are obtained as a function of frequency. These provide qualitative information on the radial depth of investigation with flexural wave logging. The flexural wave excitation function is a measure of the energy that a source converts to flexural motion. We deduce an expression for the flexural wave excitation and show that its bandlimited characteristic is influenced by both the borehole diameter and formation parameters. From the dispersion curves and excitation functions, we can compute the flexural waveforms caused by a dipole source with arbitrary orientation in the borehole. In the numerical computations, we have used the unperturbed mode shapes for an equivalent isotropic medium together with the perturbed dispersion relations caused by the formation anisotropy.",10.1190/1.1443660
New Spectral Lanczos Decomposition Method For Induction Modeling In Arbitrary 3-D Geometry,"Traditional resistivity tools are designed to function in vertical wells. In horizontal well environments, the interpretation of resistivity logs becomes much more difficult because of the nature of 3-D effects such as highly deviated bed boundaries and invasion. The ability to model these 3-D effects numerically can greatly facilitate the understanding of tool response in different formation geometries. Three‐dimensional modeling of induction tools requires solving Maxwell's equations in a discrete setting, either finite element or finite difference. The solutions of resulting discretized equations are computationally expensive, typically on the order of 30 to 60 minutes per log point on a workstation. This is unacceptable if the 3-D modeling code is to be used in interpreting induction logs. In this paper we propose a new approach for solutions to Maxwell's equations. The new method is based on the spectral Lanczos decomposition method (SLDM) with Krylov subspaces generated from the inverse powers of the Maxwell operator. This new approach significantly speeds up the convergence of standard SLDM for the solution of Maxwell's equations while retaining the advantages of standard SLDM such as the ability of solving for multiple frequencies and eliminate completely spurious modes. The cost of evaluating powers of the matrix inverse of the stiffness operator is effectively equivalent to the cost of solving a scalar Poisson's equation. This is achieved by a decomposition of the stiffness operator into the curl‐free and divergence‐free projections. The solution of the projections can be computed by discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) and preconditioned conjugate gradient iterations. The convergence rate of the new method improves as frequency decreases, which makes it more attractive for low‐frequency applications. We apply the new solution technique to model induction logging in geophysical prospecting applications, giving rise to two orders of magnitude convergence improvement over the standard Krylov subspace approach and more than an order of magnitude speed‐up in terms of overall execution time. This makes it feasible to routinely use 3-D modeling for model‐based interpretation, a breakthrough in induction logging and interpretation.",10.1190/1.1444579
Using Constraints To Address The Instabilities Of Automated Prestack Velocity Analysis,"Generalized prestack velocity analysis methods that use an automated approach to resolve laterally variable interval velocity fields are beset by a series of problems. The problem of resolving lateral velocity variations has inherent complications that prevent automated methods from being robust enough to be applied routinely to data from a variety of geologic provinces. The use of automated prestack velocity analysis methods will not eliminate the step of carefully producing an initial velocity model derived from regional geologic information and an interpretation of a conventionally processed section. For the methods to regularly produce useful additional information, the unique characteristics of each application must be input into the prestack velocity analysis with the use of inversion constraints. These constraints serve either to adapt the generalized prestack velocity analysis to a focused objective in a particular area or to provide iterative, interpretational tools that help the user produce a velocity model.",10.1190/1.1443255
"Synthetic Seismic Sections For Acoustic, Elastic, Anisotropic, And Vertically Inhomogeneous Layered Media","Synthetic seismic sections computed during forward modeling differ depending upon the type of media used to define the model. Four media types considered here are acoustic, elastic, elliptically anisotropic, and vertically inhomogeneous; significant differences are found among the seismic sections for these cases. Automatic ray generation, using kinematic and dynamic analog groups, permits retention and explicit identification of all significant arrivals, including primaries, multiples, converted waves, etc., for three‐dimensional, horizontally layered structures. Comparisons between arrivals common to the various models are shown by synthetic trace sections, amplitude‐distance plots, and velocity spectra. Results show significant energy in converted waves in the elastic models and marked differences between amplitude‐distance curves for elastic and acoustic cases. Anisotropic media produce noticeable differences in both amplitude‐ and time‐distance curves as a function of the degree of anisotropy. Modeling with vertically inhomogeneous media is practical and appealing because of how velocity and density functions are defined. Interestingly, a diving wave of high amplitude shown in our seismograms closely resembles the strong first arrival often present on field‐recorded seismograms.",10.1190/1.1442124
Acoustic And Elastic Numerical Wave Simulations By Recursive Spatial Derivative Operators,A new scheme for the calculation of spatial derivatives has been developed. The technique is based on recursive derivative operators that are generated by an  L∞  fit in the spectral domain. The use of recursive operators enables us to extend acoustic and elastic wave simulations to shorter wavelengths. The method is applied to the numerical solution of the 2D acoustic wave equation and to the solution of the equations of 2D dynamic elasticity in an isotropic medium. An example of reverse-time migration of a synthetic data set shows that the numerical dispersion can be significantly reduced with respect to schemes that are based on finite differences. The method is tested for the solutions of the equations of dynamic elasticity by comparing numerical and analytic solutions to Lamb's problem.,10.1190/1.3485217
Scattering Of Shear Waves By Small Transeismic Obstacles,"Using spherical vector wave functions, the general problem of the scattering of plane transverse waves by a transeismic sphere is formulated. The far‐field result for a small sphere is presented. One part of the scattered field arises from the density contrast between the sphere and the external medium, and another part arises from the rigidity contrast. Each contrast results in a scattered compressional wave having radial displacements, and a transverse wave having displacements parallel to the sphere's surface. The four fields are represented graphically. The density contrast produces a dipolar compressional field and a toroidal transverse field. The displacements of both are symmetric about a line in the direction of polarization of the incident wave, and are otherwise independent of the direction of incidence. The rigidity contrast produces a quadrupolar compressional field, and a transverse field for which the directivity pattern is given. A model is presented which gives the relative displacement directions of this last field. The scattered fields due to the density contrast behave as though they were due to a pure displacement oscillation of the sphere, and those due to the rigidity contrast as though they were due to a pure distortional oscillation.",10.1190/1.1439536
Wave Tilt Of Radio Waves Propagating Over A Layered Ground,"We call attention here to the limitation of the ""Q approximation"" in characterizing the complex wave tilt W over a layered half‐space. Using an improved formulation the frequency dependence of W is shown to be a discriminator of the electrical characteristic of the subsurface. The height dependence of the observer is also illustrated.",10.1190/1.1444083
"Mapping Of Apparent Magnetic Susceptibility And The Identification Of Fractures: A Case Study From The Eye-Dashwa Lakes Pluton, Atikokan, Ontario","In situ magnetic-susceptibility measurements are only possible on outcrops, which are often limited by overburden and water bodies. An alternative approach is to derive an apparent susceptibility map from total-magnetic-intensity (TMI) surveys, which was done in this study for the Eye-Dashwa Lakes pluton near Atikokan, Ontario. Susceptibility logs of cores directly link alteration to systematic changes in the amount and composition of magnetic minerals. The surficial distribution of alteration zones was originally estimated from a limited number of in situ magnetic-susceptibility measurements. Here, through forward modeling of the TMI data set, susceptibility data are used to validate the apparent susceptibility data set. The modeling accounts for the bathymetric surface of all lakes that cover the area. A two-step process of bulk and local-scale modeling was used to estimate apparent susceptibility patterns. Bulk magnetic susceptibility is used as an indicator of overall alteration content, and local-scale apparent magnetic-susceptibility values are computed using a forward-modeling routine. The new apparent magnetic data set indicates northwest and northeast linears, which are the same as those seen in previous studies.",10.1190/1.3427636
Statistical Determination Of Geophysical Well Log Response Functions,"The vertical response function of induction logging tools is shown to be derivable from a power spectrum analysis of the measurement. The vertical response function is the one‐dimensional sequence of weights that characterizes how the tool combines the rock conductivities along the borehole to form an output called the apparent conductivity; it is the system impulse response. The value of knowing this function lies in the possible use of filter theory to aid in data processing and interpretation. Two general notions establish the framework for the analysis. The first is that logging is a linear, convolutional operation. Second, the earth's conductivity profile forms a stochastic process. The probabilistic component is fleshed out by reasonably based assumptions about the occurrence of bed boundaries and nature of conductivity changes across them. Brought together, these tenets create a characterization of the conductivity sequence that is not a stationary process, but rather is intrinsic, as defined in the discipline of geostatistics. Such a process is described by a variogram, and it is increments of the process that are stationary. The connection between the power spectrum of the measurement and the system response function is made when the convolutional model is merged with the conductivity process. Some examples of induction log functions are shown using these ideas. The analysis is presented in general terms for possibly wider application.",10.1190/1.1441435
Simulation Of Full Responses Of A Triaxial Induction Tool In A Homogeneous Biaxial Anisotropic Formation,"Triaxial induction tools are used to evaluate fractured and low-resistivity reservoirs composed of thinly laminated sand-shale sequences. Thinly laminated and fractured reservoirs demonstrate transversely isotropic or fully anisotropic (biaxial anisotropic) electrical properties. Compared to the number of studies on transverse isotropy, relatively little work covers biaxial anisotropy because of the mathematical complexity. We have developed a theoretical analysis for the full response of a triaxial induction tool in a homogeneous biaxial anisotropic formation. The triaxial tool is composed of three mutually orthogonal transmitters and three mutually orthogonal receivers. The bucking coils are also oriented at three mutually orthogonal directions to remove direct coupling. Starting from the space-domain Maxwell's equations, which the electromagnetic (EM) fields satisfied, we obtain the spectral-domain Maxwell's equations by defining a Fourier transform pair. Solving the resultant spectral-domain vector equation, we can find the spectral-domain solution for the electric field. Then, the magnetic fields can be determined from a homogeneous form of Maxwell's equations. The solution for the EM fields in the space domain can be expressed in terms of inverse Fourier transforms of their spectral-domain counterparts. We use modified Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and contour integration methods to evaluate the inverse Fourier transform efficiently. Our formulations are based on arbitrary relative dipping and azimuthal and tool angles; thus, we obtain the full coupling matrix connecting source excitations to magnetic field response. We have validated our formulas and investigated the effects of logging responses on factors such as relative dipping, azimuthal and tool angles, and frequency using our code. We only consider conductivity anisotropy, not anisotropy in dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. However, our method and formulas are straightforward enough to consider anisotropy in dielectric permittivity.",10.1190/1.3336959
Potential‐Field Inversion: Choosing The Appropriate Technique To Solve A Geologic Problem,"To produce a unique and stable solution in potential‐field interpretation, an inversion method must introduce particular constraints. These constraints will inevitably restrict the type of geological setting where the method may be applied. We present a nonmathematical overview of most stabilizing constraints used in inversion methods. Our purpose is to demonstrate that the inversion results are valuable only if the mathematical stabilizing constraints are translated from the geological setting. We identify five basic types of constraints: (1) lower and upper bounds of parameter estimates; (2) proximity of a parameter estimate to a specified value; (3) proximity between pairs of parameter estimates; (4) concentration of the anomalous source about a geometrical element such as an axis; and (5) source compactness. In practice, if used in isolation, constraints (1), (2), (4), and (5) will not produce geologically meaningful results, regardless of the geological setting of the interpretation area. Constraint (3) may produce geologically meaningful results if the anomalous source has a spatially smooth attribute such as the physical property. We illustrate that constraints 1–4, if used in isolation, cannot delineate the geometry of a simulated sill intruded into a sedimentary basin. The basic constraints may (and should) be combined in inversion to produce geologically meaningful results. We present two examples of effective constraint combination: (1) proximity to a specific value and mass concentration about an axis (used to delineate the thickness variation of a sill intruded in a sedimentary basin) and (2) inequality, proximity of a parameter estimate to a specified value, and proximity between pairs of parameter estimates (used to map a discontinuous basement relief). Usually, the stabilizing constraints are too restrictive to hold at all points of a given geological environment. In this case, we use different constraints in different sub‐areas. Each constraint is based on its compatibility with the actual geology of the subarea.",10.1190/1.1444941
Obliquity-Correction Imaging Condition For Reverse Time Migration,The quality of seismic images obtained by reverse time migration (RTM) strongly depends on the imaging condition. We propose a new imaging condition that is motivated by stationary phase analysis of the classical crosscorrelation imaging condition. Its implementation requires the Poynting vector of the source and receiver wavefields at the imaging point. An obliquity correction is added to compensate for the reflector dip effect on amplitudes of RTM. Numerical experiments show that using an imaging condition with obliquity compensation improves reverse time migration by reducing backscattering artifacts and improving illumination compensation.,10.1190/1.3110589
Relation Of Seismic Corrections To Surface Geology,"The arbitrary application of any set type of near‐surface corrections to seismic data can lead to erroneous results. The determination of the type of correction to be used must be based, in part, on the type of formations present in the near‐surface. Case studies are offered to illustrate conditions arising in areas of youthful and mature topography. Specifically, they deal with a complex low velocity layer problem in a river valley, a pre‐glacial topography in the Illinois Basin, a problem arising in a mature topography in Kansas, and a youthful topography in central Wyoming. In such cases, the use of a ""floating"" elevation reference plane is advocated for the ""Correction Zone"" lying immediately below the surface.",10.1190/1.1437747
Nonlinear Refraction Traveltime Tomography,"A few important issues for performing nonlinear refraction traveltime tomography have been identified. They include the accuracy of the traveltime and raypath calculations for refraction, the physical information in the refraction traveltime curves, and the characteristics of the refraction traveltime errors. Consequently, we develop a shortest path ray‐tracing method with an optimized node distribution that can calculate refraction traveltimes and raypaths accurately in any velocity model. We find that structure ambiguity caused by short and long rays in the seismic refraction method may influence the inversion solution significantly. Therefore, we pose a nonlinear inverse problem that explicitly minimizes the misfits of the average slownesses (ratios of traveltimes to the corresponding ray lengths) and the apparent slownesses (derivatives of traveltimes with respect to distance). As a result, we enhance the resolution as well as the convergence speed. To regularize our inverse problem, we use the Tikhonov method to avoid solving an ill‐posed inverse problem. Errors in refraction traveltimes are characterized in terms of a common‐shot error, a constant deviation for recordings from the same shot, and a relative traveltime‐gradient error with zero mean with respect to the true gradient of the traveltime curve. Therefore, we measure the uncertainty of our tomography solution using a nonlinear Monte Carlo approach and compute the posterior model covariance associated with two different types of random data vectors and one random model vector. The nonlinear uncertainty analysis indicates that the resolution of a tomography solution may not correspond to the ray coverage. We apply this tomography technique to image the shallow velocity structure at a coastal site near Boston, Massachusetts. The results are consistent with a subsequent drilling survey.",10.1190/1.1444468
Which Parameterization Is Suitable For Acoustic Vertical Transverse Isotropic Full Waveform Inversion? Part 2: Synthetic And Real Data Case Studies From Valhall,"It is necessary to account for anisotropy in full waveform inversion (FWI) of wide-azimuth and wide-aperture seismic data in most geologic environments, for correct depth positioning of reflectors, and for reliable estimations of wave speeds as a function of the direction of propagation. In this framework, choosing a suitable anisotropic subsurface parameterization is a central issue in monoparameter and multiparameter FWI. This is because this parameterization defines the influence of each physical parameter class on the data as a function of the scattering angle, and hence the resolution of the parameter reconstruction, and on the potential trade-off between different parameter classes. We apply monoparameter and multiparameter frequency-domain acoustic vertical transverse isotropic FWI to synthetic and real wide-aperture data, representative of the Valhall oil field. We first show that reliable monoparameter FWI can be performed to build a high-resolution velocity model (for the vertical, the horizontal, or normal move-out velocity), provided that the background models of two Thomsen parameters describe the long wavelengths of the subsurface sufficiently accurately. Alternatively, we show the feasibility of the joint reconstruction of two wave speeds (e.g., the vertical and horizontal wave speeds) with limited trade-off effects, while Thomsen parameter δ is kept fixed during the inversion. The influence of the wave speeds on the data for a limited range of scattering angles when combined each other can, however, significantly hamper the resolution with which the two wave speeds are imaged. These conclusions inferred from the application to the real data are fully consistent with those inferred from the theoretical parameterization analysis of acoustic vertical transverse isotropic FWI performed in the companion report.",10.1190/geo2012-0203.1
A Theoretical Study Of Induced Electrical Polarization,"A mathematical solution is obtained and numerically evaluated for determining the depth to a saturated aquifer when prospecting for ground water by induced electrical polarization. In a horizontally stratified earth model consisting of a nonpolarizable overburden and an underlying, infinitely deep polarizable layer, the induced‐polarization potential difference for a Wenner electrode configuration is nearly independent of the resistivity contrast. The computation agrees with results from a laboratory model tank and with a field curve. This justifies confidence in the validity of the results obtained from the model tank on earth models too complex for computation.",10.1190/1.1438404
Field Testing Seismic Instruments,"The field tests compiled here are designed to detect the presence of the subtle as well as the obvious equipment troubles. Auxiliary test equipment used includes a low distortion sine wave oscillator, oscilloscope, geophone shaketable, and a timing standard as well as the usual voltmeter, ammeters, and ohmmeters which are often built in the equipment. Field test procedures on geophones, cables, seismic amplifier, seismic oscilloscope cameras, magnetic seismic recorders are included. The time lapse between each test is considered, but some flexibility in this respect is recognized, depending on the specific equipment used and the operating conditions.",10.1190/1.1438661
A Robust Integral Equation Solution For Electromagnetic Scattering By A Thin Plate In Conductive Media,"An integral equation solution for electromagnetic (EM) scattering by a thin plate robustly models scattering in either perfectly resistive, very resistive, or conducting host media. Because the solution is not restricted to modeling certain ranges of host conductivity, it can be used to model scattering over the large ranges in conductivity encountered in geophysics. The solution is developed around a pair of coupled integral equations for the scattering distributions on the plate. In one equation, the scattering distribution is the scalar potential set up by the scattered charge distribution. In the other, it is the component of the scattered magnetic field perpendicular to the plate. The equations are solved numerically using the Galerkin method with simple polynomial basis functions. To find the fields scattered by the conductor, the scattered current density is first calculated from the scalar potential and the magnetic field. The scattered fields can then be found by integrating over the scattered current density. To test the solution, we model horizontal loop EM responses with our solution and compare the results with those from two established integral equation solutions. One of these solutions models pure induction and is used to test our solution when the host is perfectly resistive. Agreement with this solution is very good. Comparisons with the other solution, an electric field integral equation, tests our solution when the host medium is conductive. Agreement with the latter solution is good where induction is not too strong: i.e., where the electric‐field solution is known to work well. Our solution therefore can accurately model EM scattering by a plate in a host medium with any conductivity.",10.1190/1.1443133
"The Geology And Geophysics Of The Odem Oil Field, San Patricio County, Texas","The Odem field, located in southern San Patricio County, Texas, was discovered in the latter part of 1939. Prior to 1933, the Odem area received a limited amount of geological and geophysical exploration, and several test wells were drilled. These tests were dry and the area apparently condemned until a reflection seismograph survey indicated structure. Subsequent drilling confirmed the presence of a structure containing several producing horizons. The proven limits of production conformed closely to the contours of the original seismograph map.",10.1190/1.1437289
Finite‐Difference Migration Derived From The Kirchhoff‐Helmholtz Integral,Finite‐difference (FD) migration is one of the most often used standard migration methods in practice. The merit of FD migration is its ability to handle arbitrary laterally and vertically varying macro velocity fields. The well‐known disadvantage is that wave propagation is only performed accurately in a more or less narrow cone around the vertical. This shortcoming originates from the fact that the exact one‐way wave equation can be implemented only approximately in finite‐difference schemes because of economical reasons. The Taylor or continued fraction expansion of the square root operator in the one‐way wave equation must be truncated resulting in an approximate version of the one‐way wave equation valid only for a restricted angle range.,10.1190/1.1444063
Estimating And Correcting The Amplitude Radiation Pattern Of A Virtual Source,"In the virtual source (VS) method we crosscorrelate seismic recordings at two receivers to create a new data set as if one of these receivers were a virtual source and the other a receiver. We focus on the amplitudes and kinematics of VS data, generated by an array of active sources at the surface and recorded by an array of receivers in a borehole. The quality of the VS data depends on the radiation pattern of the virtual source, which in turn is controlled by the spatial aperture of the surface source distribution. Theory suggests that when the receivers are surrounded by multi-component sources completely filling a closed surface, then the virtual source has an isotropic radiation pattern and VS data possess true amplitudes. In practical applications, limited sourceaperture and deployment of a single source type create an anisotropic radiation pattern of the virtual source, leading to distorted amplitudes. This pattern can be estimated by autocorrelating the spatial Fourier transform of the downgoing wavefield in the special case of a laterally invariant medium. The VS data can be improved by deconvolving the VS data with the estimated amplitude radiation pattern in the frequency-wavenumber domain. This operation alters the amplitude spectrum but not the phase of the data. We can also steer the virtual source by assigning it a new desired amplitude radiation pattern, given sufficient illumination exists in the desired directions. Alternatively, time-gating the downgoing wavefield before crosscorrelation, already common practice in implementing the VS method, can improve the radiation characteristics of a virtual source.",10.1190/1.3073003
Ionospheric Induced Very Low‐Frequency Electric Field Wavetilt Changes,"Very low‐frequency (VLF) electric field wavetilt measurements were made continuously over a period of four months at a fixed location. Daytime and nighttime values of the wavetilt were found to be relatively constant. During sunrise and sunset the wavetilt decreased to 20 percent of the daytime value, making wavetilt measurements meaningless for two three‐hour intervals during a 24 hour period. A mechanism involving modal interference is postulated.This phenomenon may be a problem in other passive electromagnetic (EM) prospecting systems including audio‐frequency magnetic and audiomagnetotelluric.",10.1190/1.1441282
Joint Inversion Of Multiple Geophysical Data Using Guided Fuzzy C-Means Clustering,First presented at the SEG 82nd and 83rd Annual International Meetings.,10.1190/geo2015-0457.1
Hydrostatic Pressurization Of Magnetite,"Study of the effect of mechanical deformation on magnetic minerals indicates the structure‐sensitive character of a parameter such as coercive force. Magnetoelastic effects and stress‐induced rearrangement of the magnetic domain pattern lead to changes in magnetic remanence. Such work has relevance to basic studies in rock magnetism and paleomagnetism. The effect of increase in hydrostatic pressure on rocks with depth may have application in geophysical prospecting. For example, it could be a factor in the interpretation of magnetic well logging for remanence (Frey, 1951; Khramov, 1957) and susceptibility (Broding et al, 1952; Anderson, 1968), or interpretation of magnetic anomalies from deep‐seated sources.",10.1190/1.1440048
Automatic Generation Of 3D Geophysical Models Using Curvatures Derived From Airborne Gravity Gradient Data,"A method for automatic 3D model generation derived from airborne gravity gradient data was illustrated. The proposed method computed a volumetric distribution of curvatures that form a 3D image of possible density distributions. The method relies on spectral analysis and the equivalence of the power spectra of the classical mean and differential curvatures of equipotential surfaces to create pseudodepth slices of a quantity that describes the geometry of the surfaces: the shape index. The method was carried out in three steps. First, the pseudodepth slices of the vertical gravity gradient and the magnitude of the differential curvature components were generated. Second, equivalent pseudodepth slices of the shape index were generated. Finally, 3D interpolation was carried out to obtain the final model. The synthetic model data indicated that the vertical density contrasts were well modeled. A 3D model derived from FALCON airborne gravity gradiometer data from the Canning Basin, Australia, was compared to an independently interpreted integrated 3D earth geologic model.",10.1190/geo2013-0436.1
Desired Seismic Characteristics Of An Air Gun Source,"Marine seismic data are generally contaminated with both ""bubble pulses"" and ""tow noise."" Air gun sources are deployed in arrays designed to reduce the effective level of the bubble pulses. Because the signal from a source array is profoundly altered by the filter characteristics of the earth and because the received signal is subjected to noise‐generating computer processes such as deconvolution, array designs should be optimized to obtain the minimum aggregate noise, and hence the greatest reflection stand‐out, in output traces. For a fixed air‐compressor capacity, a trade‐off in array design exists between maximizing source strength and the fine tuning required to maximize the first‐pulse‐to‐bubble ratio. Except for shallow, high‐resolution surveys where the deconvolution step can be bypassed, optimum suppression of total noise in the output can often be obtained using the available air capacity to increase the source strength of a moderately tuned array, rather than to achieve fine tuning of the array. Processing noise produced by deconvolution will prevent detection of a weak reflection closely following a strong one if the ratio of the two is more than about 21 dB, no matter how finely tuned the source array may be.",10.1190/1.1441387
"Advances Of Geophysical Prospecting For Petroleum In Marine Carbonate Areas Of The Upper Yangtze Region, Southern China","In the marine carbonate area of the upper Yangtze region, southern China, including parts of Guizhou and Sichuan Provinces, complex subsurface structures and undulating surface terrain exist because of multiple tectonic events. Various geophysical prospecting methods have been conducted in local areas in an attempt to map these structures. In the Guizhou Plateau, a carbonate‐exposed area, crooked seismic lines were acquired using vibrators as the main source, supplemented with dynamite. In Sichuan Province, a mountainous area, regional seismic profiles, wide‐line profiling, and 3-D seismic surveys were conducted. These were accomplished with portable air drills and human transport. Data processing techniques were designed to improve data quality in the presence of noise and to image complex structures. In central Sichuan Province, high‐resolution and converted‐wave seismic surveys were carried out for imaging complex structures and for collecting lithologic parameters. These methods have enabled us to get effective information from complex structural, mountainous, and carbonate‐exposed hilly areas in the upper Yangtze region of southern China. These collective efforts have produced a database appropriate for sedimentology, tectonic, and prospective area evaluation studies.",10.1190/1.1443866
Seismic Data Processing: Current Industry Practice And New Directions,"The last ten years have seen an evolution in the state of the art for seismic data processing on a number of fronts. Data transformations investigated have made some types of analyses much more straightforward. Deconvolution has become a sophisticated process which includes statistical, model‐based, and deterministic methods. Vibroseis® processing has led to a greater understanding of the statistical limitations in recovery of the wave‐field amplitude from sign‐bit recording, and the deconvolution of Vibroseis data has improved. Multichannel filtering and analysis in transform domains have resulted in increasingly effective tools for noise reduction and signal enhancement. In statics analysis, surface consistency as a constraint remains a standard, and refraction analysis has become popular as a means of preconditioning data for residual statics estimation. Advances in stacking methodology have come mainly from addressing three effects: ray bending through lateral velocity variations, complex structure, and source‐receiver azimuth variations. Recently many techniques of interpretation processing have been introduced with the goal of improving the estimate of earth properties, rather than generating a stacked or imaged section of higher fidelity. The interaction among related disciplines has increased and this serves to amplify the effectiveness of each discipline because they are now developing in less isolation.",10.1190/1.1441876
Multidimensional Scaling For The Evaluation Of A Geostatistical Seismic Elastic Inversion Methodology,"Due to the nature of seismic inversion problems, there are multiple possible solutions that can equally fit the observed seismic data while diverging from the real subsurface model. Consequently, it is important to assess how inverse-impedance models are converging toward the real subsurface model. For this purpose, we evaluated a new methodology to combine the multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique with an iterative geostatistical elastic seismic inversion algorithm. The geostatistical inversion algorithm inverted partial angle stacks directly for acoustic and elastic impedance (AI and EI) models. It was based on a genetic algorithm in which the model perturbation at each iteration was performed recurring to stochastic sequential simulation. To assess the reliability and convergence of the inverted models at each step, the simulated models can be projected in a metric space computed by MDS. This projection allowed distinguishing similar from variable models and assessing the convergence of inverted models toward the real impedance ones. The geostatistical inversion results of a synthetic data set, in which the real AI and EI models are known, were plotted in this metric space along with the known impedance models. We applied the same principle to a real data set using a cross-validation technique. These examples revealed that the MDS is a valuable tool to evaluate the convergence of the inverse methodology and the impedance model variability among each iteration of the inversion process. Particularly for the geostatistical inversion algorithm we evaluated, it retrieves reliable impedance models while still producing a set of simulated models with considerable variability.",10.1190/geo2013-0037.1
Extraction Of Deep Crustal Reflections From Shallow Vibroseis Data Using Extended Correlation,"Lower crustal seismic reflections can be extracted from shallow crustal seismic profiles through the application of extended correlation to uncorrelated Vibroseis seismic data. ""Fixed‐bandwidth"" extended correlation shortens the correlation operator before crosscorrelation, producing reflections over an increased correlation time range, all with lowered bandwidth. ""Self‐truncating"" extended correlation preserves the full bandwidth in the original seismic reflection times but loses bandwidth in a predictable manner at the additional (later) arrival times. Correlation wavelet shape and extra correlation time are directly related and can be calculated for specific acquisition parameters. Pre‐correlation tapering is necessary to avoid undue wavelet distortion at extended correlation times. Seismic data collected in the Basin and Range province illustrate the application of the method; the results are verified with conventional correlations of long sweep records and with impulsive source data.",10.1190/1.1442682
Parallel Matrix Factorization Algorithm And Its Application To 5D Seismic Reconstruction And Denoising,"Tensors, also called multilinear arrays, have been receiving attention from the seismic processing community. Tensors permit us to generalize processing methodologies to multidimensional structures that depend on more than 2D. Recent studies on seismic data reconstruction via tensor completion have led to new and interesting results. For instance, fully sampled noise-free multidimensional seismic data can be represented by a low-rank tensor. Missing traces and random noise increase the rank of the tensor. Hence, multidimensional prestack seismic data denoising and reconstruction can be tackled with tools that have been studied in the field of tensor completion. We have investigated and applied the recently proposed parallel matrix factorization (PMF) method to solve the 5D seismic data reconstruction problem. We have evaluated the efficiency of the PMF method in comparison with our previously reported algorithms that used singular value decomposition to solve the tensor completion problem for prestack seismic data. We examined the performance of PMF with synthetic data sets and with a field data set from a heavy oil survey in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.",10.1190/geo2014-0594.1
Assessing Estimated Velocity-Depth Models: Finding Error Bars In Tomographic Inversion,"In conventional migration velocity analysis methods, a velocity model is estimated that results in flattened events in common-image gathers. However, after this process, no information is available on the accuracy of this velocity model. A statistical analysis of velocity-model parameters is very difficult because of the integrated nature of the process. In common-focus-point technology, velocity estimation is split into two processes: a first step to estimate one-way focusing operators from the seismic data and a second step to translate these one-way propagation operators into a velocity-depth model. Because the second step does not involve seismic data and uses a hands-off model parameterization, a statistical analysis of the inversion result becomes rather straightforward. We developed a methodology for obtaining a suite of possible solutions, from which statistical measures can be extracted. By varying initial settings, the inversion of one-way traveltimes provides a space of solutions. Rather than having a single estimated model, we can obtain an ensemble of models. By performing statistical analysis of this ensemble, the error bars of the estimated velocity model can be retrieved. The procedure was tested for a 2D synthetic and field data set, for which the latter compares favorably to a conventional two-way traveltime tomography approach. The information provided by such an analysis is important because it shows the reliability of the final estimated model and could provide feedback for acquisition geometry design. More or better data might be needed to obtain a model to which a smaller degree of ambiguity is associated.",10.1190/1.2951469
The Covariance Of External Shot Noise At A Sensor Array,"Noise (of seismic and other origins) is often modeled as a shot process, i.e., as a random combination of wavelets. Specifically, if X is the random noise process and g is the deterministic waveform of the wavelet, then ",10.1190/1.1440385
Diffraction Of Electromagnetic Waves By An Inhomogeneous Sphere,The electromagnetic response of an inhomogeneous conducting sphere (having radial conductivity distribution) embedded in an infinite homogeneous medium is investigated. The effect of linear conductivity variation and magnetic contrast between the two media is discussed in detail and relevant curves are presented. Analytical results are further extended to a more general situation in which this sphere is located in a half‐space and the influence of air‐earth boundary is calculated. These results may be applied to geoelectrical interpretation.,10.1190/1.1439050
High-Frequency Electromagnetic Impedance Method For Subsurface Imaging,"At high frequencies the EM impedance is a function of the angle of incidence or the horizontal wavenumber, so the electrical properties cannot be readily extracted without eliminating the effect of horizontal wavenumber on the impedance. For this purpose, this paper considers two independent methods for accurately determining the horizontal wavenumber, which in turn is used to correct the impedance data. The apparent electrical properties derived from the corrected impedance data correlate poorly to the real structure, especially for the model with a resistive overburden. However, the impedance data along with the incidence angles thus estimated can be successfully inverted to yield an accurate subsurface layering through the simulated annealing inversion scheme.",10.1190/1.1468610
Gravity Inversion Of A Discontinuous Relief Stabilized By Weighted Smoothness Constraints On Depth,"We present a new stable gravity inversion method applied to the mapping of an interface separating two homogeneous media. In contrast with previous similar methods, it does not impose an overall smoothness on the estimated interface to stabilize the solution. The density contrast between the media is assumed to be known. The interpretation model for the upper medium consists of rectangular juxtaposed prisms whose thicknesses represent the depths to the interface and are the parameters to be estimated. The true interface is assumed to be flat everywhere except at faults. To incorporate this attribute into the estimated relief, we developed an iterative process in which three kinds of constraints are imposed on parameters: (1) proximity between values of adjacent parameters, (2) lower and upper bounds to parameters, and (3) proximity between the values of parameters and fixed numerical values. Starting with an initial solution which presents an overall smooth relief, the method enhances initially estimated geometric features of the interface; that is, flat areas will tend to become flatter and steep areas will tend to become steeper. This is accomplished by weighting the constraints, which requires proximity between adjacent parameters. The weights are initialized with values equal to unity and are updated automatically to enhance any discrepancy between adjacent depths that have been detected at the initial solution. Constraints 2 and 3 are used both to compensate for the decrease in solution stability caused by the introduction of small weights and to reinforce flatness at the basin bottom. Constraint 2 imposes that any depth be nonnegative and smaller than an a priori known maximum depth value, whereas constraint 3 imposes that all depths be closest to a value greater than the maximum depth. The trade‐off between these conflicting constraints is attained with a final relief presenting flat bottom and steep borders. The method was tested with a synthetic gravity anomaly produced by a simulated sedimentary cratonic extensional basin whose basement consists of steep edges and a flat bottom. The results showed an improvement in the resolution of the relief, leading to a reliable mapping both of the sharp discontinuities at the borders and of the lateral extent of the base of the basin. Additionally, the method produced excellent estimates for the average dip angles of the basin edges (presumably controlled by normal faults), indicating, in this way, its potential in interpreting data produced by this kind of basin. The method was applied to the Bouguer anomaly from the northern portion of Steptoe Valley, Nevada, delineating an isolated basin with a wider, flat base and relatively straight borders as compared with the estimate imposing overall smoothness on the relief.",10.1190/1.1444647
Refraction And Reflection Of Seismic Waves—Ii Discussion Of The Physics Of Refraction Prospecting,"We observe that there are five principal factors governing the intensity of the refracted wave of ""refraction prospecting."" It is shown that a clear understanding of this process can lead to decided improvements in the geophysicist's interpretation of refraction data.",10.1190/1.1440499
Aspects Of Time‐Variant Filtering,"We develop a computationally efficient time‐variant filter with idealized band‐pass characteristics, i.e., with a time‐variant boxcar‐like frequency spectrum. The filter can either be zero phase, or it can effect a time‐variant phase rotation of the input data. The instantaneous low‐frequency and high‐frequency cutoffs are independent, continuous time functions that are specified by the user. In addition, frequency‐domain rolloff characteristics of the filter can be prescribed, but the achieved spectrum depends on the length of the applied filter and the instantaneous frequency cutoffs used. The primary derivation of our theory for time‐variant filtering depends upon the properties of the complex signal and the complex delta function. This formulation is particularly insightful because of the geometrical interpretation it offers in the frequency domain. Basically, a high‐pass filter can be implemented by shifting the Fourier transform of the complex signal towards the negative frequency band, annihilating that portion of the signal that lies to the left of the origin, and then shifting the truncated spectrum back to the right. This geometrical insight permits us to infer the mathematical form of a general time‐variant band‐pass filter. In addition, we show that our time‐variant filter reduces to a Hilbert transform filter when the derivation is constrained to include real signal input.",10.1190/1.1442419
Relative Performance Of Moveout‐Based Multiple‐Suppression Methods For Amplitude Variation With Offset (Avo) Analysis And Common Midpoint (Cmp) Stacking,"The f–k approach is unsuitable prior to AVO analysis; moreover, it is little better in suppressing the multiples than the CMP stack itself. Hampson's method performs considerably better and is suitable for both purposes, although it can yield distorted AVO response where multiples are relatively strong on input. At about 50% additional computation effort over that of Hampson's method, the hybrid approach has superior treatment of amplitude behavior with offset. For many situations, the hybrid method yields up to twice the primary‐to‐multiples amplitude ratio on the CMP stack.",10.1190/1.1649395
Aquatic Electrical Resistivity Imaging Of Shallow-Water Wetlands,"This study uses aquatic electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to predict spatial and temporal patterns of pore-fluid conductivity in wetland soils of a shallow-water wetland. The technique involves floating electrodes from a paddleboat. Resistivity measurements for the study were obtained six times over a four-month period, covering a   10,000- m2    grid. Three-dimensional inversion is used in the study to determine the conductivity distribution of the subsurface, using the smoothness-constrained least-squares optimization method. Surface water depth and conductivity were entered as known information in the 3D inversion and measurement error (for constraining the inversion) estimated from tie points. Pore-fluid conductivity was constrained using (1) surface conduction measurements obtained from laboratory experiments on soils extracted from the wetland and (2) a correction for temporal and spatial temperature variations using direct surface water temperature measurements. The study demonstrates that aquatic ERI is an ideal method for determining the resistivity structure of wetland sediments covered by a shallow surface water layer. In the field example presented here, changes in pore-water conductivity estimated from inverted models suggest that contamination migrates from marginal landfills into the wetland soils during rainfall.",10.1190/1.2750667
Interpretation Of The Magnetic Anomalies Over Some Precambrian Dikes,"In this paper, some examples of the influence of the remanent magnetism of rocks on magnetic fields are presented. In the study, a series of dikes were investigated since, in this case, the geometry is simple and the fields can be calculated with some precision. A large number of samples were collected and the remanent magnetization and susceptibility measured. Using this information the expected curves for ground vertical component magnetic profiles and airborne magnetic profiles were computed. These were then compared with the actual observed profiles. A good correlation was found when both remanent and induced magnetization were considered. In determining the remanent magnetization intensity, samples that had unusually high Q values were rejected because these probably represented local effects due to lightning strikes. In addition, the mean value of the magnetization was determined by taking into account the scatter of directions of the measured NRM's. The agreement between observed and computed data was good.",10.1190/1.1439652
Spectral-Decomposition Response To Reservoir Fluids From A Deepwater West Africa Reservoir,"We study the spectral-decomposition response to reservoir fluids from a deepwater West Africa reservoir through a systematic modeling approach. Our workflow starts from selecting the seismic data (far-angle seismic images) that show more pronounced fluid effect based on amplitude-versus-offset (AVO) analysis. Synthetic seismic forward modeling performed at the control well established the quality of the seismic well tie. Reservoir wedge modeling, spectral decomposition of the field and synthetic seismic data, and theoretical analyses were conducted to understand the spectral-decomposition responses. The reservoir fluid type is a main factor controlling the spectral response. For this deepwater reservoir, the amplitude contrast between oil sand and brine sand is higher at low frequencies   (∼15 Hz)  . In addition, synthetic modeling can help identify the possible frequency band where the amplitude contrast between hydrocarbon sand and brine sand is higher. When properly included in a comprehensive direct-hydrocarbon-indicator (DHI)–AVO evaluation, spectral decomposition can enhance the identification of hydrocarbons.",10.1190/1.2978337
Linear Approximation Of Apparent Resistivity Functions,"Linear expressions are sufficient for the approximation of resistivity functions, if the trend of the resistivity contrasts is taken into account. The maximum error in two‐layer systems has been determined. Application to more than two layers and interpretation methods are investigated. Three‐layer examples are discussed.",10.1190/1.1438967
Design Of Small Operators For The Continuation Of Potential Field Data,"Two‐dimensional continuation of potential fields is commonly achieved by employing a continuation operator which consists of a number of coefficients operating upon uniformly gridded field data. To obtain accurate results, the size of the operator has to be quite large. This not only requires a lot of computational work, but also causes a considerable loss of information due to the reduced size of the field obtained after continuation. Small‐size ""equivalent"" operators were designed which are free from these drawbacks but yield accurate results. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of these operators, a potential field was continued upward by using 31×31 Tsuboi coefficients. This required 961 multiplications for computing the continued field at each grid point. When procedure was repeated using the equivalent operator, the number of multiplications required for each grid point was reduced to 15, the size of the resulting map was much larger, but the results in both cases were practically identical in accuracy. Frequency characteristics of the equivalent operators and the continuation of data very close to the boundary of the field map are discussed.",10.1190/1.1440275
Revealing Stratigraphy In Ground‐Penetrating Radar Data Using Domain Filtering,"A common‐offset ground‐penetrating radar profile was collected from a mid‐continent fluvial environment characterized by sand with discontinuous clay layers. Signal was separated from coherent noise by a domain filter that exploits local differences in dip between signal and noise. This filter proved effective in separating reflections from the direct air wave and from system ringing. The processed section locates the base of a Pleistocene river channel incised into bedrock and shows a change in a recent position of the river on the basis of radar character. The water table, which lies at a depth of approximately 2 m, is characterized by a continuous reflection. An earlier reflection is interpreted as a perched lens of water near the ground surface. The predominant frequency of both reflections varies greatly with position along the profile. Shallow cores taken along the profile provide evidence that grain size in the transition zone from saturated to unsaturated sediments may determine the predominant frequency of the associated radar reflection. The domain filter is also successful in separating transition zone reflections from saturated layer boundary reflections that are coincident in arrival time. It is possible, therefore, to determine both grain size in the transition zone and the dip of sediments immediately beneath it even if the reflections from the two are superimposed.",10.1190/1.1444548
Discussions On Induced Polarization: Authors' First Reply,"Dr. James R. Wait invited us to comment on his discussion of our paper in the July, 1957, issue of Geophysics. We are grateful for this opportunity, since a clarification of some basic concepts appears necessary.",10.1190/1.1486542
Theory Of Nonstationary Linear Filtering In The Fourier Domain With Application To Time‐Variant Filtering,"A general linear theory describes the extension of the convolutional method to nonstationary processes. This theory can apply any linear, nonstationary filter, with arbitrary time and frequency variation, in the time, Fourier, or mixed domains. The filter application equations and the expressions to move the filter between domains are all ordinary Fourier transforms or generalized convolutional integrals. Nonstationary transforms such as the wavelet transform are not required. There are many possible applications of this theory including: the one‐way propagation of waves through complex media, time migration, normal moveout removal, time‐variant filtering, and forward and inverse Q filtering. Two complementary nonstationary filters are developed by generalizing the stationary convolution integral. The first, called nonstationary convolution, corresponds to the linear superposition of scaled impulse responses of a nonstationary filter. The second, called nonstationary combination, does not correspond to such a superposition but is shown to be a linear process capable of achieving arbitrarily abrupt temporal variations in the output frequency spectrum. Both extensions have stationary convolution as a limiting form and, in the discrete case, can be formulated as matrix operations. Fourier transformation shows that both filter types are nonstationary filter integrals in the Fourier domain as well. This result is a generalization of the convolution theorem for stationary signals because, as the filter becomes stationary in one domain, the integral in the other domain collapses to a scalar multiplication. For discrete signals, stationary filters are a matrix multiplication of the input signal spectrum by a diagonal spectral matrix, while nonstationary filters require off‐diagonal terms. For quasi‐stationary filters, a computational advantage is obtained by computing only the significant terms near the diagonal. Unlike stationary theory, a mixed domain of time and frequency is also possible. In this context, the nonstationary filter is applied simultaneously with the transform from time to frequency or the reverse. Nonstationary convolution becomes a generalized forward Fourier integral and nonstationary combination is a generalized inverse Fourier integral.",10.1190/1.1444318
Asymptotic Expansions For Transient Electromagnetic Fields,"Asymptotic expansions may be derived for transient electromagnetic (EM) fields. The expansions are valid when σμ0l2/t is less than about 0.1. Here l, σ, μ0, and t are the respective lengths, conductivities, permeabilities of free space and time. Cases for which asymptotic expansions are presented include (1) layered grounds, (2) axisymmetric structure, and (3) two‐dimensional (2-D) structures. In all cases the transient voltage eventually approaches that of the host medium alone, the ratio of anomalous response to the half‐space response being proportional to 1/tν. Here v is equal to 0.5 for layered structures and 1.0 for 2-D or 3-D structures.",10.1190/1.1441279
"High-Frequency Rayleigh-Wave Tomography Using Traffic Noise From Long Beach, California","Using a dense seismic array in Long Beach, California, we have investigated the effectiveness of using traffic noise for passive subsurface imaging. Spectral analysis revealed that traffic-induced vibrations dominate the ambient seismic noise field at frequencies between 3 and 15 Hz. Using the ambient-noise crosscorrelation technique at these frequencies, we have extracted fundamental- and first-order-mode Rayleigh waves generated by Interstate 405 and local roads. We picked group traveltimes associated with the fundamental mode and used them in a straight-ray tomography procedure to produce group velocity maps at 3.0 and 3.5 Hz. The velocity trends in our results corresponded to shallow depths and coincided well with lithologies outlined in a geologic map of the survey area. The most prominent features resolved in our velocity maps were the low velocities to the north corresponding to less-consolidated materials, high velocities to the south corresponding to more-consolidated materials, a low-velocity zone corresponding to artificial fill in Alamitos Bay, and a low-velocity linear feature in the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone. Our resulting near-surface velocities can be useful for identifying regions that are susceptible to serious damage during earthquake-related shaking.",10.1190/geo2015-0415.1
Leaky Mode: A Mechanism Of Horizontal Seismic Attenuation In A Gas-Hydrate-Bearing Sediment,"The leaky mode is a possible attenuation mechanism of seismic waves propagating along lamination in gas-hydrate-bearing sediment layers. This horizontal propagation attenuation mechanism occurs when a high-velocity layer is embedded in a low-velocity zone. This is a typical situation for gas hydrate occurrences. To quantify this attenuation mechanism, a 2D digital rock model based on the crosswell data of the Mallik 2002 Gas Hydrate Production Research Well Program is used. For simplicity, our elastic simulations exclude attenuation mechanisms like scattering loss or intrinsic absorption. We demonstrate that the leaky mode is a significant horizontal attenuation mechanism that cannot be neglected. The effective attenuation of gas-hydrate-bearing sediments is a combination of intrinsic and scattering attenuation by small-scale heterogeneties and the leaky mode.",10.1190/1.2750375
Seismic Velocities In Transversely Isotropic Media,"When a sedimentary earth section is layered on a scale much finer than the wavelength of seismic waves, the waves average the physical properties of the layers; a seismic wave acts as if it were traveling in a single, transversely isotropic solid. We compute the velocities with which P‐waves, SV‐waves, and SH‐waves travel in transversely isotropic solids formed from two‐component solids and find the corresponding moveout velocities from t2-x2 plots. The combinations studied are sandstone and shale, shale and limestone, water sand and gas sand, and gypsum and unconsolidated material, one set of typical physical properties being selected for each component of a combination. A reflector at 1524 m and a geophone spread of 0–3048 m are assumed. The moveout velocity for an SH‐wave is always the velocity for a wave traveling in the horizontal direction. The P‐wave moveout velocity found from surface seismic data can be anywhere from the vertical P‐wave velocity to values between those for vertical and horizontal travel; the actual value depends on the elastic parameters and the spread length used for velocity determination. If the two components of the solid have the same Poisson's ratio, the velocity from surface‐recorded data is the vertical P‐wave velocity. For this case, SH‐wave anisotropy can be computed. SV‐wave data usually do not have hyperbolic time‐distance curves, and the moveout velocity found varies with spread length. Surprisingly, the water sand‐gas sand combination gives a medium with negligible anistropy. A two‐component combination of gypsum in weathered material gives rise to t2-x2 plots that seem to explain the unusual behavior of near‐surface SV‐waves seen in field studies reported by Jolly (1956).",10.1190/1.1440985
Automatic Velocity Analysis With Reverse-Time Migration,"We apply a method to automatically estimate the background velocities using reverse-time migration. The method uses a combination of differential semblance and similarity-index (a.k.a., ""semblance"" or ""stacking-power"") to measure the focusing error in imaging and a nonlinear optimization procedure to obtain the background velocities. A challenge in this procedure is that, for media consisting of complex and strongly refracting velocities, artifacts in the reverse-time migrated image (low-frequency noise) can cause the velocity analysis to diverge. We successfully overcome this issue by applying a simple vertical derivative filter to the image that is input to velocity analysis. The resultant velocity analysis method is tested in two 2D synthetic examples and one 2D field data example. Due to the assumptions inherent to prestack depth migration, the data that are input to velocity analysis must be singly scattered. To apply the method to multiple-rich data, we propose an image-based demultiple method. The method consists of muting events in the subsurface offset common image point gathers constructed with reverse-time migration, and remodeling the data using a kinematic demigration. A field data example shows how the image-based demultiple of the data helps to improve the velocity analysis in the presence of multiple scattering.",10.1190/geo2012-0064.1
Three‐Dimensional Model—Gulf Of Mexico,"The 1969 U. S. Geological Survey Sparker Survey of the Gulf of Mexico was used to construct a three‐dimensional model. The result is a comprehensive presentation which quickly conveys an understanding of the main features of the Gulf of Mexico basin. The time and equipment needed to construct this model were minimal, and the method is adaptable for any area. The model indicates that the geologic composition of the Gulf of Mexico is varied. The profiles show sedimentary dips and no‐reflection areas that can be interpreted as homogeneous masses such as salt. The massive salt off the Texas‐Louisiana coast is truncated and does not overflow the Abyssal Plain sediments. The salt trends inland between Tampico and Veracruz. Massive salt reenters the Gulf from the Isthmian Tertiary salt basin of Mexico furnishing the salt for the Sigsbee knolls. If salt exists under the Florida scarp, it forms a ridge rather than massive salt. Igneous plugs are present between Cuba and Florida. In the Abyssal Plain the sediments are a minimum of 10,000 to 20,000 ft thick. The thickest sediments are adjacent to the Sigsbee scarp. The structures in the Abyssal Plain are many and varied. This study indicates that the entire Gulf of Mexico could be a potential hydrocarbon‐bearing province. The sedimentary thickness in both the shelf and Abyssal Plain area is sufficient for hydrocarbon accumulations.",10.1190/1.1440340
On Seismic Deghosting Using Integral Representation For The Wave Equation: Use Of Green'S Functions With Neumann Or Dirichlet Boundary Conditions,"The recent interest in broadband seismic technology has spurred research into new and improved seismic deghosting solutions. One starting point for deriving deghosting methods is the representation theorem, which is an integral representation for the wave equation. Recent research results show that by using Green's functions with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the representation theorem, source-side deghosting of already receiver-side deghosted wavefields can be achieved. We found that the choice of Green's functions with Neumann boundary conditions on the sea surface and the plane that contains the sources leads to an identical but simpler solution with fewer processing steps. In addition, we found that pressure data can be receiver-side deghosted by introducing Green's functions with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the sea surface and the plane containing the receivers into a modified representation theorem. The deghosting methods derived from the representation theorem are wave-theoretic algorithms defined in the frequency-space domain and can accommodate streamers of any shape (e.g., slanted). Our theoretical analysis of deghosting is performed in the frequency-wavenumber domain where analytical deghosting solutions are well known and thus are available for verifying the solutions. A simple numerical example can be used to show how source-side deghosting can be performed in the space domain by convolving data with Green's functions.",10.1190/geo2012-0305.1
Perturbation Approach To Depth Extrapolation,"The Born-series solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation does not necessarily converge properly for depth-extrapolation problems. Even more seriously, the Lippmann-Schwinger equation is not necessarily self-consistent for depth extrapolation, unless it is interpreted correctly. A solution is proposed by using the generalized Lippmann-Schwinger equation that includes boundary value contributions that normally are ignored. A modified version of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for depth extrapolation is obtained. The corrections to the Born-series expansion for depth extrapolation are demonstrated. The new system has the desired convergence and self-consistency properties. Explicit depth extrapolation is discussed in the context of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. A partial explanation for why explicit depth extrapolation works reasonably well in laterally inhomogeneous media may be that the contribution from the perturbation term in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for that problem is small for a wide variety of velocity models.",10.1190/1.1852786
Vertical Seismic Profile Polarization Method For Determining Reflector Orientation,"The strike and dip of the reflecting interfaces in the vicinity of a well can be derived from VSP data recorded with a three‐component downhole seismometer. The method relies on measuring the polarizations in the direct and reflected compressional waves. The mathematical relation which is the basis of the method is exact only when the seismometer is positioned at the depth where the interface intersects the well. At that depth the polarization of the reflected wave cannot be measured because of interference with the direct wave. The orientation of the normal to the reflector can be determined to within 2° when the polarizations of the direct and reflected waves are determined within 100 m of the reflector. If the direct and reflected waves can be identified without multidepth processing, only measurements at a single depth are required to determine the reflector orientation. Error analysis and statistical refinement can be achieved by measuring the polarizations at several seismometer depths, source azimuths, or source offsets. The method is robust in the sense that the error in the interface orientation cannot exceed the error in the measurement of the polarizations. The method should be useful in structurally complex areas provided the reflections can be observed at depths above the depths of generation.",10.1190/1.1442556
Integral Equation Modeling Of Three‐Dimensional Magnetotelluric Response,"We have adapted a three‐dimensional (3-D) volume integral equation algorithm to magnetotelluric (MT) modeling. Incorporating an integro‐difference scheme increases accuracy somewhat. Utilizing the two symmetry planes of a buried prismatic body and a normally incident plane wave source greatly reduces required computation time and storage. Convergence checks and comparisons with one‐dimensional (1-D) and two‐dimensional (2-D) models indicate that our results are valid. We show theoretical surface anomalies due to a 3-D prismatic conductive body buried in a half‐space earth. Instead of studying the electric and magnetic fields, we have obtained impedance tensor and magnetic transfer functions by imposing two different source polarizations. Manipulation of the impedance tensor and magnetic transfer functions yields the following MT quantities: apparent resistivity and phase, impedance polar diagrams, tipper direction and magnitude, principal directions, skew, and ellipticity. With our preliminary analyses of these MT quantities, we have found that three‐dimensionality is usually revealed by all of them. Furthermore, we have recognized two pairs of complementary parameters: apparent resistivity and phase, and skew and ellipticity. Because of surface charges at conductivity boundaries, low‐frequency 3-D responses are much different from 1-D and 2-D responses. Thus, in many cases 3-D models are required for interpreting MT data. Although an overall 3-D MT interpretation is still not practical due to high computer costs and the complicated structure of the true earth, combined 2-D and 3-D modeling can be applied to yield a gross 3-D structure, which is composed of a cross‐section and its strike extent. In doing so, we suggest that the cross‐section be obtained from higher frequency 2-D E‐perpendicular (E⊥) mode modeling, and that the strike extent be derived by matching with lower frequency E‐parallel (E∥) mode results due to corresponding 3-D models. In addition, we have indicated that some simple 3-D features, e.g., location above conductive zone, corners, and symmetry lines, can easily be recognized from the surface MT response.",10.1190/1.1441188
Earth'S Free Modes And A New Gravimeter,"Gravitational observations of free vibrations of the earth due to the Alaskan earthquake of March, 1964 were compared with corresponding results for the Chilean earthquake. In the graver spheroidal modes of periods greater than 7 minutes which were compared, the periods generally agreed within a few parts per thousand. The freemode spectrum has been used by Anderson, Landisman, and others to improve models of the earth. To fit both the free mode periods and the seismic data, Anderson's modification of classical earth models introduces a more rapid increase of density in the upper mantle, and less rapid increase near the core. In addition to the precise set of numbers characterizing the free periods, the free mode observations supply another independent set of criteria in the form of the ""Q"" values for the different modes. The large Q value of more than 25,000 for the purely radial mode excited by the Alaskan quake is noteworthy. In gravity observations of the earth's oscillations, of period one hour or more, and especially in observations of the semidiurnal and diurnal tides, the vertical component is observable with greater reliability than is the horizontal component. Improved instrument sites, probably drill‐hole sites, seem to be required. A laboratory model for a simple type of drill‐hole gravimeter incorporating a new efficient transducer due to R. Havens was shown. The instrument has a 20‐sec period, and in preliminary tests shows a sensitivity of a few microgals.",10.1190/1.1439580
Damped Multichannel Singular Spectrum Analysis For 3D Random Noise Attenuation,"Multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) is an effective algorithm for random noise attenuation in seismic data, which decomposes the vector space of the Hankel matrix of the noisy signal into a signal subspace and a noise subspace by truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD). However, this signal subspace actually still contains residual noise. We have derived a new formula of low-rank reduction, which is more powerful in distinguishing between signal and noise compared with the traditional TSVD. By introducing a damping factor into traditional MSSA to dampen the singular values, we have developed a new algorithm for random noise attenuation. We have named our modified MSSA as damped MSSA. The denoising performance is controlled by the damping factor, and our approach reverts to the traditional MSSA approach when the damping factor is sufficiently large. Application of the damped MSSA algorithm on synthetic and field seismic data demonstrates superior performance compared with the conventional MSSA algorithm.",10.1190/geo2015-0264.1
Reverse Time Imaging Of Ground-Penetrating Radar And Sh-Seismic Data Including The Effects Of Wave Loss,"The presence of wave loss (velocity dispersion and attenuation in lossy media) degrades the resolution of migrated images by distorting the phase and amplitude of the signal. These effects have to be mitigated to improve resolution. We have developed a technique to perform reverse time migration of ground-penetrating radar and SH-seismic data in lossy media, suitable for engineering and seismic applications. The method is based on the solution of the transverse magnetic (TM) Maxwell equation, which in view of the acoustic-electromagnetic analogy, is mathematically equivalent to the SH-wave equation, where attenuation is described by the Maxwell mechanical model. Attenuation compensation is performed by reversing the sign of the diffusion term (first-order time derivative). In this manner, the TM equation has the same wave-velocity dependence with frequency (same velocity-dispersion behavior) but opposite attenuation, i.e., compensating for attenuation effects when back propagating. We have solved the equations numerically with a direct grid method by using the Fourier pseudospectral operator for computing the spatial derivatives, and we used an explicit staggered second-order finite-difference approximation for computing the time derivative. Four applications illustrated the potential of the algorithm. The migrated image by correcting for attenuation loss is able to improve the illumination of the target reflectors. This migration is found to be particularly useful to balance the overall image amplitude by illuminating shadow zones. Under the assumption of low-loss media (e.g., Q≫1) and thicknesses comparable with or smaller than the skin depth, the attenuation-compensated migration is stable.",10.1190/geo2015-0397.1
Elastic Wave-Mode Separation For Vti Media,"Elastic wave propagation in anisotropic media is well represented by elastic wave equations. Modeling based on elastic wave equations characterizes both kinematics and dynamics correctly. However, because P- and S-modes are both propagated using elastic wave equations, there is a need to separate P- and S-modes to efficiently apply single-mode processing tools. In isotropic media, wave modes are usually separated using Helmholtz decomposition. However, Helmholtz decomposition using conventional divergence and curl operators in anisotropic media does not give satisfactory results and leaves the different wave modes only partially separated. The separation of anisotropic wavefields requires more sophisticated operators that depend on local material parameters. Anisotropic wavefield-separation operators are constructed using the polarization vectors evaluated at each point of the medium by solving the Christoffel equation for local medium parameters. These polarization vectors can be represented in the space domain as localized filtering operators, which resemble conventional derivative operators. The spatially variable pseudo-derivative operators perform well in heterogeneous VTI media even at places of rapid velocity/density variation. Synthetic results indicate that the operators can be used to separate wavefields for VTI media with an arbitrary degree of anisotropy.",10.1190/1.3184014
Correspondence Between Membrane Potential And Conductivity,"Combining the membrane potential Em with the corresponding ideal membrane potential Ei and the liquid junction potential E𝓁j, for the same activity ratio, gives Ei-EmEi-E𝓁j=σ˜wFσ˜≡1F〈σwσ〉. σw and σ˜± are the reciprocal of the average of the reciprocal water conductivity and reciprocal of cation and anion conductivities, and σ˜=σ˜++σ˜-; and 〈σw/σ〉 is the average of the ratio of the water to the rock conductivity σw/σ with respect to (1-t)dlnn⁁γ±, where t is the transport number for the Na ion, n⁁ is the ionic concentration, and γ± is the activity coefficient. This relationship is independent of any model and does not even refer to the value of clay counterion concentration. Combining σ with Em gives the saturation dependent formation factor F, and thus the interpretation of shaly sands becomes no more difficult than for clean sands. Experimental data on 27 rocks for which both membrane potential and conductivity were measured by Smits (1968) and Waxman and Smits (1968) over a large salinity range are used to verify this relationship.",10.1190/1.1443063
The Development And Applications Of Airborne Magnetometers In The U.S.S.R.,"Translator's Note: These three papers by A. A. Logachev describe the pioneer work by the Russians in magnetic exploration with airborne equipment. Partly because of the language and partly because of the obscurity of the journals in which it was published, information on this work has not been widely circulated among American geophysicists. It is hoped that these translations will be of historical if not of practical interest to the profession.",10.1190/1.1437230
Improving Plane‐Wave Decomposition And Migration,"Plane‐wave data can be produced by slant stacking common geophone gathers over source locations. Practical difficulties arise with slant stacks over common receiver gathers that do not arise with slant stacks over common‐midpoint gathers. New techniques such as hyperbolic velocity filtering allow the production of high‐quality slant stacks of common‐midpoint data that are relatively free of artifacts. These techniques can not be used on common geophone data because of the less predictive nature of data in this domain. However, unlike plane‐wave data, slant stacks over midpoint gathers cannot be migrated accurately using depth migration. A new transformation that links common‐midpoint slant stacks to common geophone slant stacks allows the use together of optimized methods of slant stacking and accurate depth migration in data processing. Accurate depth migration algorithms are needed to migrate plane‐wave data because of the potentially high angles of propagation exhibited by the data and because of any lateral velocity variations in the subsurface. Splitting the one‐way wave continuation operator into two components (one that is a function of a laterally independent velocity, and a residual term that handles lateral variations in subsurface velocities) results in a good approximation. The first component is applied in the wavenumber domain, the other is applied in the space domain. The approximation is accurate for any angle of propagation in the absence of lateral velocity variations, although with severe lateral velocity variations the accuracy is reduced to 50°. High‐quality plane‐wave data migrated using accurate wave continuation operators results in a high‐quality image of the subsurface. Because of the signal‐to‐noise content of this data the number of sections that need to be migrated can be reduced considerably. This not only saves computer time, more importantly it makes computer‐intensive tasks such as migration velocity analysis based on maximizing stack power more feasible.",10.1190/1.1444119
Simulating True Amplitude Reflections By Stacking Shot Records,"Field seismograms resulting from concentrated sources provide  the starting point for all acquisition, processing, analysis, and interpretation techniques in seismic exploration. As pointed  out recently by Bortfeld (1982), Hubral (1983), and Krey (1983), certain benefits with respect to improving (a) pulse deconvolution, (b) poststack migration, and in particular (c) the estimation of interface reflection coefficients, can however be gained by transmitting so‐called normal waves to (generally curved) reflectors in a laterally inhomogeneous earth.",10.1190/1.1441664
Construction Of The Generalized One‐Dimensional Synthetic Seismograms By A Three‐Step Extrapolation Procedure,"In a recent publication, Gutowski and Treitel (1987) gave a clear exposition of one‐dimensional (1-D) modeling. They considered the most general case of arbitrary locations of source and receiver within the layered medium, where the source may have different downgoing and upgoing strengths and may be above or below the receiver. The solution, in the form of two rational polynomial expressions in the Z-transform domain, was analyzed in detail for some interesting special cases.",10.1190/1.1442732
"Electrical, Electromagnetic, And Magnetotelluric Methods","Application of electrical methods began with Robert W. Fox's 1830 observation of self potentials associated with copper vein deposits in Cornwall. Conrad Schlumberger introduced the direct current equal potential line resistivity method in 1912. Harry W. Conklin received the first patents on the electromagnetic (EM) method in 1917. From these beginnings, the history of the development of the resistivity induced‐polarization (IP), magnetotelluric and EM methods are traced to the present time. It is of interest to note that application of electrical methods flourished from about 1920 to 1930, but then the methods were developed slowly until after World War II when a major burst of development activity took place. However, the interpretational basis of the methods remained poor until the last several years when application of numerical techniques using computers permitted forward and inverse solutions to electrical boundary value problems in two and three dimensions. Field hardware gradually evolved from 1960 through 1980 to permit precise broadband IP, electromagnetic, and magnetotelluric data acquisition with coherent detection and remote reference noise rejection, in‐field digital data processing and interpretation. The future of electrical methods is briefly sketched, with trends largely toward better numerical interpretation schemes, more broadband applications, more sophisticated use of in‐field digital acquisition processing and interpretation schemes, and accommodation of more channels of information.",10.1190/1.1441056
Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis Of Multiple Sinusoids In Noise,"An analytical technique based on the method of undetermined coefficients is applied to the problem of computing the theoretical spectral estimate by the maximum entropy method (MEM) when the autocorrelation function of the data is known exactly and corresponds to N sinusoids in additive white noise and to N sinusoids in additive 1-pole, low‐pass noise. For the white noise case, the L prediction filter coefficients are expanded directly in terms of the input sinusoids. This expansion leads to a transformation of the L × L normal equations for the prediction filter coefficients to a set of 2N × 2N equations. The transformed equations are a smaller set of equations to be solved whenever L  2N and provide a convenient description of the interaction between the various frequency components of the sinusoids which occurs in the MEM estimate. Further, for certain cases where there is little interaction between some of the frequency components of the sinusoids, the solution of the 2N × 2N equations may be approximated (to zeroth order) by the solution of a smaller set of coupled equations. A better approximation to the exact solution of the 2N × 2N equations can then be obtained from a perturbation expansion of the exact solution about the zeroth order approximation. For the case of N sinusoids in l‐pole, low‐pass noise, the L prediction filter coefficients are expanded in terms of the input sinusoids as well as two delta functions which occur at the beginning and end of the filter. This expansion also leads to a set of 2N × 2N equations. For this case the values of the MEM estimate evaluated at the frequencies of the sinusoids are shown to be a function of the frequencies of the sinusoids. This result is reasonable since the signal‐to‐noise ratio per unit bandwidth is also a function of frequency.",10.1190/1.1440882
A 3D Subsalt Tomography Based On Wave-Equation Migration-Perturbation Scans,"We have developed a simple but practical methodology for updating subsalt velocities using wave-equation, migration-perturbation scans. For the sake of economy and scalability (with respect to full source-receiver migration) and accuracy (with respect to common-azimuth migration), we use shot-profile, wave-equation migration. As input for subsalt-velocity analysis, we provide wave-equation migration scans with velocity scanning limited to the subsalt sediments. Throughout the migration-scan sections, we look for the best focusing or structural positioning of characteristic seismic events. The picking on the migration stacks selects the value of the best perturbation attribute (alpha-scaling factor) along with the corresponding position and local dip for the chosen seismic events. The associated, locally coherent events are then demigrated to the base of the salt horizon. Our key observation is that this process is theoretically equivalent to performing a datuming to a base of salt followed by subsalt migration of the redatumed data perturbed-velocity profiles. Thanks to this implicit redatuming of shot profiles, no ray tracing through the salt body is required. Thus, the events picked on the subsalt-velocity scans only need to be demigrated to the base of salt. For the event demigration we use 3D specular-ray tracing up to the base of the salt horizon within a predefined range of reflection angles. Event demigration produces model-independent data — time and time slope — that are then kinematically migrated using the current tomographic-inversion working model. To find a final-velocity model that will flatten best the remigrated events on common image point (CIP) angle gathers, we use the same set of demigrated observation data as the input data set for several nonlinear iterations of 3D tomographic inversion.",10.1190/1.2187720
Three-Dimensional Irregular Seismic Data Reconstruction Via Low-Rank Matrix Completion,"We have developed a new algorithm for the reconstruction of seismic traces randomly missing from a uniform grid of a 3D seismic volume. Several algorithms have been developed for such reconstructions, based on properties of the seismic wavefields and on signal processing concepts, such as sparse signal representation in a transform domain. We have investigated a novel approach, originally introduced for noise removal, which is based on the premise that for suitable representation of the seismic data as matrices or tensors, the rank of the seismic data (computed by singular value decomposition) increases with noise or missing traces. Thus, we apply low-rank matrix completion (MC) with a designed texture-patch transformation to 3D seismic data reconstruction. Low-rank components capture geometrically meaningful structures in seismic data that encompass conventional local features such as events and dips. The low-rank MC is based on nuclear-norm minimization. An efficient L1-norm minimizing algorithm, named approximate message passing, is extended to use for a general nonconvex nuclear-norm minimization problem. A fast MC algorithm named low-rank matrix fitting (LMaFit), which avoids the computation of singular value decomposition, was also considered for the 3D reconstruction. Empirical studies on synthetic and real data have shown promising performance of the method, in comparison with traditional projection onto convex sets.",10.1190/geo2012-0465.1
"High Resolution Of Glacial Ice Stratigraphy: A Ground‐Penetrating Radar Study Of Pegasus Runway, Mcmurdo Station, Antarctica","Ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) has been used to detect areas of present or potential structural weakness beneath a 3.2-km snow‐covered ice runway on the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica. The bandwidths of the transmitted wavelets were centered near 500 MHz. The data show many horizons up to tens of meters long and occurring to about a 9-m depth, below which a brine intrusion limits penetration. The horizons are interpreted as discrete scatterers because of their diffraction nature and loss of higher frequencies with depth. The presence of porous ice or dispersed water is interpreted from wavelet phase. The water may be associated with apparent deepening and fading of the brine horizon. If the above interpretation is correct, water occurs at depths to 3.5 m and extends as much as 40 m horizontally, which is greater and deeper than known previously. At 3.5 m depth, the water may be adsorbed on mineral particles rather than remain free. Migration of the diffractions with a single‐layer migration scheme shows all horizons above the brine layer to be small dielectric perturbations within the ice. Stacking and Hilbert transformation of the data reveal slight folding along the length of the runway. Loss of high‐frequency amplitude in the wavelets suggests that higher frequency radar might improve resolution only in the top few meters.",10.1190/1.1444084
A Simple Method For Decomposing Fracture‐Induced Anisotropy,"A heterogeneous mixture of isotropic elements may appear homogeneous and anisotropic when the scale of its fabric is smaller than the seismic wavelengths that measure it (Backus, 1962). These fabrics can result from thin layering or from oriented microcracks or fractures. In many situations the anisotropy is quite complex, resulting, for example, from fractures in previously anisotropic media. Since these anisotropies combine, the effect of each must be separated to permit the study of either the fractures or the preexisting anisotropy.",10.1190/1.1443149
Imaging Shallow Objects And Heterogeneities With Scattered Guided Waves,"Current surface seismic reflection techniques based on the common‐midpoint (CMP) reflection stacking method cannot be readily used to image small objects in the first few meters of a weathered layer. We discuss a seismic imaging method to detect such objects; it uses the first‐arrival (guided) wave, scattered by shallow heterogeneities and converted into scattered Rayleigh waves. These guided waves and Rayleigh waves are dominant in the shallow weathered layer and therefore might be suitable for shallow object imaging. We applied this method to a field data set and found that we could certainly image meter‐size objects up to about 3 m off to the side of a survey line consisting of vertical geophones. There are indications that cross‐line horizontal geophone data could be used to identify shallow objects up to 10 m offline in the same region.",10.1190/1.1444715
Experimental Evidence For The Biot‐Gardner Theory,"Seismic wave attenuation has been a subject of interest during the last 40 years because it may be of use in interpreting seismic data. From this attenuation parameter, more detailed information about the lithology of the subsurface may be deduced if we understand the absorption mechanisms by which dissipation of seismic energy is governed. We are, therefore, studying in the laboratory the effects of different parameters such as porosity, permeability, pore fluid, and saturation state on the absorption of seismic waves in porous rocks over a wide spectrum ranging from seismic to ultrasonic frequencies (Burkhardt et al., 1986).",10.1190/1.1442679
Traveltime Prediction And Suppression Of 3-D Multiples,"We analyze the characteristics and suppression of multiples generated in three dimensions. We derive expressions for the traveltime of peg‐leg multiples generated by two dipping planes. Using this theory, we demonstrate that multiples generated in three dimensions may have traveltimes substantially different from 2-D multiples. For a case studied of 3° cross‐line dip, second‐order water‐bottom and peg‐leg multiples arrive on the order of 10 ms earlier than they would in two dimensions. For fifth‐order multiples, this difference is as high as 65 ms. These 2-D/3-D time differences grow to many hundreds of milliseconds for 10° of cross‐line dip. We confirm the presence of the cross‐line dip effect in field data containing salt‐related multiples. Using dips estimated from a 3-D interpretation of a top‐salt horizon, we further demonstrate that the theory can accurately predict traveltimes for such multiples. Finally, based on the theory, we present an algorithm for suppressing 3-D multiples when cross‐line dip can be estimated, validating the algorithm using model and field data.",10.1190/1.1444523
Crosswell Seismic Radial Survey Tomograms And The 3-D Interpretation Of A Heavy Oil Steamflood,"S‐wave, P‐wave, and Poisson's ratio tomograms have been used to interpret the 3-D distribution of rock and fluid properties during an early phase of a California heavy oil sand steamflood. Four lines of good quality crosswell seismic data, with source to receiver offsets ranging from 287 to 551 ft (87 to 168 m), were acquired in a radial pattern around a high temperature cemented receiver cable in four days. Processing, first‐arrival picking, and good quality tomographic reconstructions were completed despite offset‐related variations in data quality between the long and short lines. Interpretation was based on correlations with reservoir models, log, core, temperature, and steam injection data. S‐wave tomograms define the 3-D distribution of the ""high flow"" turbidite channel facies, the ""moderate‐low flow"" levee facies, porosity, and structural dip. The S‐wave tomograms also define an area with anomalously low S‐wave velocity, which correlates with low shear log velocities and suggests that pressure‐related dilation and compaction may be imageable. P‐wave tomograms define the same reservoir lithology and structure as the S‐wave tomograms and the 3-D distribution of low compressional velocity zones formed by previous steam‐heat injection and the formation of gas. The low P‐wave velocity zones, which are laterally continuous in the ""high flow"" channel facies near the top of most zones, indicate that the steam‐heat‐gas distribution is controlled by stratification. The stratigraphic control of gas‐bearing zones inferred from P‐wave tomograms is confirmed by Poisson's ratio tomograms which display low Poisson's ratios indicative of gas (0.35) in the same zones as the low P‐wave velocities. The interpretation results indicate that radial survey tomograms can be tied at a central well and used to develop an integrated 3-D geoscience‐engineering reservoir model despite offset‐related variations in data quality. The laterally continuous, stratification‐controlled, low P‐wave velocity zones, which extend up‐dip, suggest that significant amounts of steam‐heat are not heating the surrounding reservoir volume but are flowing updip along ""high flow"" channels.",10.1190/1.1443804
Data Reconstruction With Shot-Profile Least-Squares Migration,"We introduce shot-profile migration data reconstruction (SPDR). SPDR constructs a least-squares migrated shot gather using shot-profile migration and demigration operators. Both operators are constructed with a constant migration velocity model for efficiency and so that SPDR requires minimal information about the underlying geology. Applying the demigration operator to the least-squares migrated shot gather gives the reconstructed data gather. SPDR can reconstruct a shot gather from observed data that are spatially aliased. Given a constraint on the geological dips in an approximate model of the earth's reflector, signal and aliased energy that interfere in the common shot data gather are disjoint in the migrated shot gather. In the least-squares migration algorithm, we construct weights to take advantage of this separation, suppressing the aliased energy while retaining the signal, and allowing SPDR to reconstruct a shot gather from aliased data. SPDR is illustrated with synthetic data examples and one real data example.",10.1190/1.3478375
Analytic Minimum Entropy Deconvolution,"The standard model of the reflection seismogram assumes an impulsive, scalar, reflectivity series convolved with a seismic wavelet. Under certain, not unlikely, conditions  a reflection coefficient can become complex and the resulting seismogram may be shown to contain phase‐shifted wavelets. When this is the case, scalar deconvolution approaches fail. To overcome this problem, Levy and Oldenburg (1982, this issue) have proposed a technique based on the analytic signal formulation. We couple the Levy and Oldenburg approach with a complex version of the minimum entropy algorithm and apply this new technique to synthetic and real examples.",10.1190/1.1441389
Rock-Physics Models For Bitumen-Saturated Sands: Fractional Gradient Model And Hashin-Shtrikman Iterative Model,"Rock-physics modeling of heavy-oil-saturated sands requires adjustments and new approaches to the available fluid-substitution schemes used on conventional reservoirs. This paper introduces two models: the fractional-gradient model (FGM) for simulating the frequency dispersion of the shear modulus of pure bitumen and the Hashin-Shtrikman iterative model (HSIM) for modeling the moduli of bitumen-saturated sands as a function of frequency and temperature. Taylor expansion shows that the first-order FGM has higher resolution than the Maxwell model and lower complexity than the Cole-Cole model. In addition, FGM is superior to Maxwell and Cole-Cole models in that viscosity modeling does not need to be done prior to shear-modulus modeling. The building of HSIM is based on observations of the microstructure of the bitumen-saturated sands. Three main characteristics in the sands are observed in the simplified model, producing a range of stiff, medium, and soft effective matrices. Bitumen can dominate the matrix as if the quartz grains were suspended in it (soft); quartz grains can surround the bitumen (stiff); and a bitumen layer can form around the quartz grain (medium). The quartz grains are assumed to be statistically spherical. HSIM is obtained by iteratively calculating the HS bounds of the stiff and soft parts of the sands. The measured shear modulus of pure bitumen and bitumen-saturated sands at different frequencies and temperatures verify the validity of these two models. The combination of these two models gives a novel fluid-substitution routine for modeling the time-lapse response during steam-assist gravity draining thermal production of bitumen. The limitations of the two models also are discussed.",10.1190/geo2011-0338.1
"Curie Point Depths Of The Island Of Kyushu And Surrounding Areas, Japan","As part of a comprehensive, nationwide evaluation of geothermal resources for Japan, the first of the Curie point depth maps, covering the island of Kyushu, has been prepared. The map was created by inverting gridded, regional aeromagnetic data. Two satisfactory algorithms were developed to invert the gridded data based upon a distribution of point dipoles. The first algorithm estimates x0,y0, and z0, the coordinates of the centroid of the distribution, by computing a least‐squares fit to the radial frequency of the Fourier transform; the second algorithm estimates centroid depth only by computing a least‐squares fit to the squared amplitude of the frequency estimates. The average depth to the top, zt of the collection of point dipoles, was estimated by a variation of the second algorithm. The depth to the bottom of the dipoles, inferred Curie point depth, is zb=2z0-zt. The depth estimates are hand contoured to produce the final map. The Curie point depth map is then compared to regional geology and heat flow data, and to a limited set of gravity data. Good correlations are found between the Curie point depths and the heat flow and regional geology. A spatial correlation observed between gravity and Curie point depths is considered a secondary, structural effect. Locations of the currently operating geothermal power plants correspond to the shallowest Curie point depths. Based on these comparisons, we conclude that the methods provide geologically reasonable results which are usable in a nationwide geothermal assessment program.",10.1190/1.1441926
Free‐Boundary Conditions Of Arbitrary Polygonal Topography In A Two‐Dimensional Explicit Elastic Finite‐Difference Scheme,"We present a simple method for simulating 2-D elastic waves in a model with free‐surface topography of polygonal shape, i.e., a continuous but irregular surface composed of line segments. Our method requires special treatment for each of the six specific cases involving line segments of various slopes as well as transition points between the sloping segments. For brevity, only nonnegatively sloping segments are specifically included. On an inclined free surface, vanishing stress conditions are implemented using a rotated coordinate system parallel to the inclined boundary. At transition points on the topography between line segments, we use a first‐order approximate boundary condition in a locally rotated coordinate system aligned with the bisector of the corner. As in the classical one‐sided explicit approximation scheme widely used for the flat free‐surface case, these extrapolation formulas are accurate to first order in spatial increment. Numerical tests indicate that the present scheme is stable over a range of Poisson's ratios of practical interest (v  0.3) for fairly complicated geometric shapes consisting of ridges and valleys with both steep and gentle slopes. Stability for complicated shapes enables us to study realistic problems for which the topography plays a significant role in shaping the wave field and for which analytical solutions are not generally available.",10.1190/1.1442541
Avo Polarization And Hodograms: Avo Strength And Polarization Product,"Attributes resulting from this methodology include (1) the polarization angle, (2) the polarization angle difference, (3) the AVO strength, (4) the polarization product, and (5) the linear‐correlation coefficient. These different attributes can then be used to enhance AVO interpretation. Synthetic modeling for a succession of gas and brine layers encased in shale units indicates that the method can potentially be an effective hydrocarbon indicator. Application of the method to a real seismic dataset shows polarization anomalies associated with hydrocarbons.",10.1190/1.1581037
Investigating Internal Magnetic Field Gradients In Aquifer Sediments,"Internal magnetic field gradients in porous materials, if sufficiently large, can be a source of error in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of the transverse relaxation time T2 and the diffusion coefficient D. Given that these measurements can provide information about the pore fluid and the pore geometry, it is important to determine the magnitude of internal gradients and assess their potential impact. We estimated the effective internal gradients in aquifer sediment samples using three methods. We used a 2D NMR method to map the distribution of internal gradients versus T2 and found gradients up to 1000  G/cm with peak gradient values in the range of 20−100  G/cm for most of the samples. The average effective gradient values, calculated from the slope of the mean log relaxation rate versus the squared echo time, typically fell above the peak gradient values in the 2D distributions, with a range from 12 to 230 G/cm. The maximum effective gradients, calculated from the magnetic susceptibility of the samples, were found to be the upper bounds for most of the gradient distributions. The mean gradient was found to increase with increasing magnetic susceptibility of the sample; however, pore size was also found to impact gradient magnitudes. Given that the distribution of internal gradient magnitudes is determined by the properties of the sediment and by the magnitude of the background field, our results have implications for the acquisition of logging and surface NMR data. We expect the internal gradients in many aquifer sediments to impact NMR logging measurements; this should be considered when selecting logging parameters and interpreting NMR logging data. In contrast, we expect internal gradients to have a negligible impact on surface NMR measurements because of the much smaller magnitude of the background magnetic field.",10.1190/geo2014-0445.1
3D Ray+Born Migration/Inversion—Part 1: Theory,"Prestack ray+Born migration/inversion can be split in two steps : the computation of common image gathers (CIGs) and their weighted stack (the migration stack). The choice of the domain for the CIGs (shot, offset, angle, etc.) has a direct impact on the resolution of the migration stack. This resolution can be studied easily in the frame of ray+Born migration/inversion theory resulting into improved migration/inversion formulas according to the acquisition geometry. This paper is devoted to this analysis in the cases of a simple 2D acquisition and of a 3D swath acquisition, both corresponding to classical data sets from the SEG/EAGE 3D overthrust experiment. We show that the migration formula originally designed for 3D marine acquisition is not adaptable to the 3D swath acquisition. Finally, we propose a new formula for this specific acquisition, which improves the resolution of the final migrated image. The relevance of this new formula is illustrated in the frame of the SEG/EAGE experiment in the companion paper.",10.1190/1.1598128
Approximate Dispersion Relations For Qp-Qsv-Waves In Transversely Isotropic Media,"To decouple qP and qSV sheets of the slowness surface of a transversely isotropic (TI) medium, a sequence of rational approximations to the solution of the dispersion relation of a TI medium is introduced. Originally conceived to allow isotropic P-wave processing schemes to be generalized to encompass the case of qP-waves in transverse isotropy, the sequence of approximations was found to be applicable to qSV-wave processing as well, although a higher order of approximation is necessary for qSV-waves than for qP-waves to yield the same accuracy. The zeroth‐order approximation, about which all other approximations are taken, is that of elliptical TI, which contains the correct values of slowness and its derivative along and perpendicular to the medium's axis of symmetry. Successive orders of approximation yield the correct values of successive orders of derivatives in these directions, thereby forcing the approximation into increasingly better fit at the intervening oblique angles. Practically, the first‐order approximation for qP-wave propagation and the second‐order approximation for qSV-wave propagation yield sufficiently accurate results for the typical transverse isotropy found in geological settings. After only slight modification to existing programs, the rational approximation allows for ray tracing, (f-k) domain migration, and split‐step Fourier migration in TI media—with little more difficulty than that encountered presently with such algorithms in isotropic media.",10.1190/1.1444788
Computation Of Dips And Azimuths With Weighted Structural Tensor Approach,"The structural tensor method can be used to compute dips and azimuths (i.e., orientation) encased in seismic data. However, this method may produce erratic and uninterpretable orientations when noisy data are encountered. To overcome this difficulty, we incorporate a data-adaptive weighting function to reformulate the gradient structural tensor. In our experiment, the squared instantaneous power is adopted as the weight factor; this can simplify the computation when the instantaneous phase is used as input. The real data examples illustrate that such a weighting function can produce more interpretable and spatially consistent orientations than conventional approaches.",10.1190/1.2235591
Separation And Enhancement Of Split S‐Waves On Multicomponent Shot Records From The Birps Wispa Experiment,"Instantaneous rotations are combined with f-k filtering to extract coherent S‐wave events from multicomponent shot records recorded by British Institutions Reflection Profiling Syndicate (BIRPS) Weardale Integrated S‐wave and P‐wave analysis (WISPA) experiment. This experiment was an attempt to measure the Poisson's ratio of the lower crest by measuring P‐wave and S‐wave velocities. The multihole explosive source technique did generate S‐waves although not of opposite polarization. Attempts to produce stacks of the S‐wave data are unsuccessful because S‐wave splitting in the near surface produced random polarizations from receiver group to receiver group. The delay between the split wavelets varies but is commonly between 20 to 40 ms for 10 Hz wavelets. Dix hyperbola are produced on shot records after instantaneous rotations are followed by f-k filtering. To extract the instantaneous polarization, the traces are shifted back by the length of a moving window over which the calculation is performed. The instantaneous polarization direction is computed from the shifted data using the maximum eigenvector of the covariance matrix over the computation window. Split S‐waves are separated by the instantaneous rotation of the unshifted traces to the directions of the maximum eigenvectors determined for each position of the moving window. F-K filtering is required because of the presence of mode converted S‐waves and S‐waves produced by the explosive source near the time of detonation. Examples from synthetic data show that the method of instantaneous rotations will completely separate split S‐waves if the length of the moving window over which the calculation is performed is the length of the combined split wavelets. Separation may be achieved on synthetic data for wavelet delays as small as two sample intervals.",10.1190/1.1443524
"Seismograph Evidence On Depth Of Salt Column, Moss Bluff Dome, Texas","Clear reflections at times of approximately 2.3 and 4.4 seconds were obtained consistently on a series of records shot directly over the shallow cap rock of the Moss Bluff dome. The earlier reflection can be interpreted as from the base of the salt column, at a depth of around 16,000 feet, or from a discontinuity within the salt column. The later reflection can be interpreted as from the base of the salt column at around 36,000 feet, from the basement complex at around 26,000 feet, or as a multiple of the reflection from the base of the salt column at around 16,000 feet. Reasons are given for preferring the multiple reflection interpretation.",10.1190/1.1437228
Effects Of Borehole Stress Concentrations On Dipole Anisotropy Measurements,"We show both experimentally and theoretically how stress concentrations affect the velocity field around a borehole, and how the velocity field influences dipole anisotropy measurements. At low frequencies the dipole mode is sensitive to the far‐field stresses primarily, so standard sonic log interpretation correctly yields the direction of maximum stress. At higher frequencies, the dipole mode is sensitive to near‐field stress concentrations such that the fast polarization direction is aligned with the direction of minimum tectonic stress. These effects combine to produce a crossover in the dipole dispersion curves measured in the fast and slow directions. With broad‐band dipole data, the dispersion crossover can be used as an indicator of stress‐induced anisotropy dominating over weak intrinsic anisotropy.",10.1190/1.1444303
Singularity Removal: A Refinement Of Resistivity Modeling Techniques,"Modeling techniques commonly exhibit errors of 3 to 10 percent or more in the calculation of apparent resistivities over earth models for which analytic solutions are easily available. A singularity occurs in the solution of any elliptic partial differential equation for which the forcing function is not smooth. The inability to adequately represent in discrete space a discontinuous function (in this case, the delta function describing the introduction of current at a point) commonly results in numerical error near the source of a modeled singularity. Inspection of an integrated finite‐difference method for modeling the dc resistivity geophysical technique indicates much of the error encountered is of singular origin. A procedure is herein detailed by which the singularity is mathematically removed from the modeling process and reintroduced as a last step, thus preventing it from contributing to the numerical error. Using this procedure, the average error in apparent resistivity values for a model of a polar‐dipole traverse over a nonconducting sphere is reduced by 40 percent. For a dipole‐dipole traverse of a two‐layer model the error decreases by 75 percent, and in the case of a Wenner profile of a model of a vertically faulted earth, the average error is diminished by 90 percent.",10.1190/1.1442704
Efficient Calculation Of The Electromagnetic Fields Of An Extended Source,"Many electromagnetic geophysical systems employ a spatially extended source (i.e., a large rectangular horizontal loop or a long grounded wire) to generate the electromagnetic (EM) field. In forward or inverse modeling, the theory and computational algorithms are usually derived for infinitesimal electric or magnetic dipole sources, or infinite line currents. However, it is often not sufficiently accurate to approximate an extended source in such a manner. Also, in many instances topographic and access problems can force the use of a source which has a complicated shape. Conceptually, there is no difficulty in expressing the actual source as an integral (line or surface) of the appropriate elementary source. However, if the integration is carried out numerically, the algorithm for calculating the field of the elementary source may have to be evaluated many times, and the calculation may become impractically long.",10.1190/1.1441618
Estimating Slowness Dispersion From Arrays Of Sonic Logging Waveforms,"Acoustic wave propagation in a fluid‐filled borehole is affected by the type of rock which surrounds the hole. More specifically, the slowness dispersion of the various body‐wave and borehole modes depends to some extent on the properties of the rock. We have developed a technique for estimating the dispersion relations from data acquired by full‐waveform digital sonic array well‐logging tools. The technique is an extension of earlier work and is based on a variation of the well‐known Prony method of exponential modeling to estimate the spatial wavenumbers at each temporal frequency. This variation, known as the forward‐backward method of linear prediction, models the spatial propagation by purely real‐valued wavenumbers. The Prony exponential model is derived from the physics of borehole acoustics under the assumption that the formation does not vary in the axial or azimuthal dimensions across the aperture of the receiver array, but can vary arbitrarily in the radial dimension. The exponential model fits the arrivals of body waves (i.e., head waves) well, because the body waves are dominated by a pole rather than a branch point. Examples of this processing applied to synthetic waveforms, laboratory scale‐model data, and field data illustrate the power of the technique and verify its ability to recover dispersion relations from sonic array data. The interpretation of the estimated dispersion in terms of rock properties is not discussed.",10.1190/1.1442322
Interpretation Of Input Aem Measurements In Areas Of Conductive Overburden,"During the past six years, the INPUT system has established itself as the world's most widely used airborne electromagnetic system. From experience with the currently available aids for interpretation it became obvious that more research was needed to understand the effects of conductor size, dip, and depth and also the effect of conductance (σt) of dikes and overburden. An extensive program of time‐domain model measurements with a new Mk VI receiver was initiated to provide the needed answers. In the modeling approach, dike‐like conductors and overburden were simulated by thin aluminum sheets, and the effect of host rock was neglected. The results obtained agree well with previous experiments which were conducted mostly in the frequency domain. Because this project surpassed others in its extent and in the variety of models, new conclusions about the nature of certain anomaly types could be made. In the case of dipping dikes under a horizontal layer of infinite extent, the anomaly shapes were found, to change considerably as a function of the conductances of the bodies involved. For certain combinations of dip, depth, and conductance the peaks on channel one changed into troughs. As the anomaly patterns obtained over horizontal strips and some dipping dikes are similar, a recognition problem may arise in this case, The resulting ambiguity in interpretation is best resolved by measuring with an additional horizontal‐coil receiver, and profiles were obtained with this configuration over a number of models. Detailed quantitative interpretation of data recorded in areas of Western Australia, which are covered by conductive overburden, was made possible by their comparison with the Atlas of INPUT Model Profiles.",10.1190/1.1440541
True-Amplitude Kirchhoff Depth Migration In Anisotropic Media: The Traveltime-Based Approach,"True-amplitude Kirchhoff depth migration is a classic tool in seismic imaging. In addition to a focused structural image, it also provides information on the strength of the reflectors in the model, leading to estimates of the shear properties of the subsurface. This information is a key feature not only for reservoir characterization, but it is also important for detecting seismic anisotropy. If anisotropy is present, it needs to be accounted for during the migration. True-amplitude Kirchhoff depth migration is carried out in terms of a weighted diffraction stack. Expressions for suitable weight functions exist in anisotropic media. However, the conventional means of computing the weights is based on dynamic ray tracing, which has high requirements on the smoothness of the underlying model. We developed a method for the computation of the weight functions that does not require dynamic ray tracing because all necessary quantities are determined from traveltimes alone. In addition, the method led to considerable savings in computational costs. This so-called traveltime-based strategy was already introduced for isotropic media. We extended the strategy to incorporate anisotropy. For verification purposes and comparison to analytic references, we evaluated 2.5D migration examples for qPqP and qPqSV reflections. Our results confirmed the high image quality and the accuracy of the reconstructed reflectivities.",10.1190/geo2012-0390.1
A Rapid Method For Measuring The Profile Components Of Horizontal And Vertical Gravity Gradients,"The trend in gravity exploration in the past years indicates the rather remarkable fact that a method of low resolving power (the gravity meter) has replaced one of higher resolving power (the torsion balance). This is entirely due to the superior speed of the former and suggests an instrument and procedure in which observation time is reduced by (1) reduction in number of quantities measured; (2) use of a reference direction near that of the maximum effect; (3) elimination of the torsionless position as unknown; (4) reduction in period, with compensating increase in optical sensitivity; (5) stabilization of thermal conditions. These objectives are attained by (1) measuring the profile components of gradients and curvature values, preferably at right angles to the assumed strike; whereby, for an ideal two‐dimensional feature, also the vertical gravity gradient is obtained, and the vertical and horizontal gravity components may be calculated by integration; (2) by holding the torsionless position constant with temperature control; (3) by decreasing the period and observation time to 3–4 minutes, and (4) by using a beam arrangement which will give the gradient in only one azimuth, and the profile gradient of the horizontal gravity component in a second azimuth if desired. Latitude and terrain corrections are also somewhat simplified by the proposed procedure.",10.1190/1.1445035
"Variogram Analysis Of Helicopter Magnetic Data To Identify Paleochannels Of The Omaruru River, Namibia","The geomagnetic field over sedimentary basins is very sensitive to variations in basement depth. Therefore, magnetic surveys are widely used to map basement topography in petroleum and groundwater exploration. We propose variogram analysis as a more accurate alternative to power spectral methods. Data variograms are computed from aeromagnetic flight‐line data. To estimate depth, the data variograms are compared with model variograms for a range of source depths. We use the exact space domain counterparts of a fractal power spectral model as model variograms. To demonstrate the utility of this method for groundwater exploration, we map the basement topography of the Omaruru Alluvial Plains in Namibia. A comparison with electromagnetic (EM) resistivities and drilling information confirms the high accuracy—but also the limitations—of variogram analysis depth. Variogram analysis makes maximum use of short‐wavelength contributions to the magnetic signal, which is the key to the resolution of shallow basement topography. Moreover, by using a realistic source model and avoiding extensive data preconditioning and the transform to wavenumber domain, variogram analysis is likely to provide improved magnetic depth estimates even for deep basins.",10.1190/1.1444588
A Linear Filter Approach To Designing Off‐Diagonal Damping Matrices For Least‐Squares Inverse Problems,"Many geophysical data processing applications are formulated as either linear or linearized‐nonlinear inverse problems. Usually, the linear systems that describe these problems are ill‐posed. For example, seismic deconvolution is an ill‐posed inverse problem because the seismic wavelet is band limited. Borehole transmission tomography is ill‐posed because of insufficient ray coverage around the tomographic model (Worthington, 1984). Surface‐consistent statics' estimation is intrinsically ill‐posed because of the geometrical relationships between the parameters defined by the surface-consistent model (Taner et al., 1974).",10.1190/1.1443308
Electromagnetic Coupling In Frequency And Time‐Domain Induced‐Polarization Surveys Over A Multilayered Earth,"Electromagnetic coupling responses in frequency and time‐domain induced‐polarization measurements over a multilayered earth are evaluated. For collinear dipole‐dipole and pole‐dipole configurations over a dissipative layered subsurface, the percent frequency effects of electromagnetic coupling are seen to be as high as 60 percent for large L2(σ1f) values, where L is the length of the receiving dipole, σ1 is the conductivity of the top layer of the half‐space, and f is the higher frequency of excitation used. In both frequency and time‐domain analyses, the distinctive effects of layering compared to that of a homogeneous half‐space response are shown for different electrode configurations, layer geometry, and electrical parameters of the subsurface. The pole‐dipole configuration of electrodes, in general, exhibits higher coupling compared to the dipole‐dipole configuration. In time‐domain measurements, the late off‐time transient decays reflect almost entirely the normal polarizability of the layered subsurface, in that the coupling responses are significant only during the early off‐time of the transient. The mutual impedance between grounded dipoles of arbitrary length is computed by extension of the complete solution of the boundary‐value problem of a horizontal electric dipole situated over a multilayered half‐space. A number of nomograms are presented for various layered structures to eliminate the electromagnetic coupling response in the induced‐polarization measurements in order to obtain the true polarization effect of the subsurface.",10.1190/1.1440348
Seismic Methods In Mineral Exploration And Mine Planning: A General Overview Of Past And Present Case Histories And A Look Into The Future,"Due to high metal prices and increased difficulties in finding shallower deposits, the exploration for and exploitation of mineral resources is expected to move to greater depths. Consequently, seismic methods will become a more important tool to help unravel structures hosting mineral deposits at great depth for mine planning and exploration. These methods also can be used with varying degrees of success to directly target mineral deposits at depth. We review important contributions that have been made in developing these techniques for the mining industry with focus on four main regions: Australia, Europe, Canada, and South Africa. A wide range of case studies are covered, including some that are published in the special issue accompanying this article, from surface to borehole seismic methods, as well as petrophysical data and seismic modeling of mineral deposits. At present, high-resolution 2D surveys mostly are performed in mining areas, but there is a general increasing trend in the use of 3D seismic methods, especially in mature mining camps.",10.1190/geo2012-0028.1
The Amplitudes Of Waves To Be Expected In Seismic Prospecting,"A method of calculating the amplitudes of bodily waves in earthquakes is applied to a study of the amplitudes of longitudinal waves produced by an artificial explosion. Formulae are given for calculating the energy of the reflected longitudinal wave arriving at the surface. The percentage of energy reflected at a discontinuity increases rapidly after the angle of incidence exceeds the critical refraction angle. However, no corresponding large amplitudes are recorded by the instruments. Instead, the maximum amplitudes of reflected waves are found near the shot point. This is because the ground movement is due both to the arriving wave and to the wave reflected downward from the ground. The amplitude of this movement depends, besides, on the rate of change of the angle of incidence with distance. It is pointed out that the same methods can be applied to a dipping bed, and that the amplitudes of the reflected waves are in general slightly larger in the up‐dip than in the down‐dip direction.",10.1190/1.1437101
"Direct Nonlinear Q-Compensation Of Seismic Primaries Reflecting From A Stratified, Two-Parameter Absorptive Medium"," Q -compensation of seismic primaries that have reflected from a stratified, absorptive-dispersive medium may be posed as a direct, nonlinear inverse scattering problem. If the reference medium is chosen to be nonattenuating and homogeneous, an inverse-scattering  Q -compensation procedure may be derived that is highly nonlinear in the data, but which operates in the absence of prior knowledge of the properties of the subsurface, including its  Q  structure. It is arrived at by (1) performing an order-by-order inversion of a subset of the Born series, (2) isolating and extracting a component of the resulting nonlinear inversion equations argued to enact  Q - compensation, and (3) mapping the result back to data space. Once derived, the procedure can be understood in terms of nonlinear interaction of the input primary reflection data: the attenuation of deeper primaries is corrected by an operator built (automatically) using the angle- and frequency variations of all shallower primaries. A simple synthetic example demonstrates the viability of the procedure in the presence of densely sampled, broadband reflection data.",10.1190/1.3337695
Interpretive Advantages Of 90°-Phase Wavelets: Part 1 — Modeling,"We discuss, in a two-part article, the benefits of 90°-phase wavelets in stratigraphic and lithologic interpretation of seismically thin beds. In Part 1, seismic models of Ricker wavelets with selected phases are constructed to assess interpretability of composite waveforms in increasingly complex geologic settings. Although superior for single surface and thick-layer interpretation, zero-phase seismic data are not optimal for interpreting beds thinner than a wavelength because their antisymmetric thin-bed responses tie to the reflectivity series rather than to impedance logs. Nonsymmetrical wavelets (e.g., minimum-phase wavelets) are generally not recommended for interpretation because their asymmetric composite waveforms have large side lobes. Integrated zero-phase traces are also less desirable because they lose high-frequency components in the integration process. However, the application of 90°-phase data consistently improves seismic interpretability. The unique symmetry of 90°-phase thin-bed response eliminates the dual polarity of thin-bed responses, resulting in better imagery of thin-bed geometry, impedance profiles, lithology, and stratigraphy. Less amplitude distortion and less stratigraphy-independent, thin-bed interference lead to more accurate acoustic impedance estimation from amplitude data and a better tie of seismic traces to lithology-indicative wireline logs. Field data applications are presented in part 2 of this article.",10.1190/1.1925740
High-Order Finite-Difference Simulations Of Marine Csem Surveys Using A Correspondence Principle For Wave And Diffusion Fields,"The computer time required to solve a typical 3D marine controlled-source electromagnetic surveying (CSEM) simulation can be reduced by more than one order of magnitude by transforming low-frequency Maxwell equations in the quasi-static or diffusive limit to a hyperbolic set of partial differential equations that give a representation of electromagnetic fields in a fictitious wave domain. The dispersion and stability analysis can be made equivalent to that of other types of wave simulation problems such as seismic acoustic and elastic modeling. Second-order to eighth-order spatial derivative operators are implemented for flexibility. Fourth-order and sixth-order methods are the most numerically efficient implementations for this particular scheme. An implementation with high-order operators requires that both electric and magnetic fields are extrapolated simultaneously into the air layer. The stability condition given for high-order staggered-derivative operators here should be equally valid for seismic-wave simulation. The bandwidth of recovered fields in the diffusive domain is independent of the bandwidth of the fields in the fictitious wave domain. The fields in the fictitious wave domain do not represent observable fields. Propagation paths and interaction/reflection amplitudes are not altered by the transform from the fictitious wave domain to the diffusive frequency domain; however, the transform contains an exponential decay factor that damps down late arrivals in the fictitious wave domain. The propagation paths that contribute most to the diffusive domain fields are airwave (shallow water) plus typically postcritical events such as refracted and guided waves. The transform from the diffusive frequency domain to the fictitious wave domain is an ill-posed problem. The transform is nonunique. This gives a large degree of freedom in postulating temporal waveforms for boundary conditions in the fictitious wave domain that reproduce correct diffusive frequency-domain fields.",10.1190/1.3278525
Operations Research—A Tool In Oil Exploration,"Operations Research is a tool which may be used by the exploration man to help in planning exploration activities and in making decisions. Electronic computers and mechanized data handling may be used in the analyses which are a part of Operations Research. Various types of exploration data which we put on punch cards are readily available for Operations Research studies. Mathematical models of various activities play a large role. They are often built up from data of past experience. Thus, statistics and probability theory are important to the studies. Other techniques commonly associated with Operations Research studies are Linear Programming, Game Theory, Queueing Theory, Monte Carlo, and Search Theory. Operations Research has been defined as quantitative common sense. It is probably the cheapest and one of the more effective of our exploration tools. We use it when we plan optimum control for a geophysical survey. We use it when we analyze the future of a frontier oil province.",10.1190/1.1438781
Stochastic Inversion For Electromagnetic Geophysics: Practical Challenges And Improving Convergence Efficiency,"Traditional deterministic geophysical inversion algorithms are not designed to provide a robust evaluation of uncertainty that reflects the limitations of the geophysical technique. Stochastic inversions, which do provide a sampling-based measure of uncertainty, are computationally expensive and not straightforward to implement for nonexperts (nonstatisticians). Our results include stochastic inversion for magnetotelluric and controlled source electromagnetic data. Two Markov Chain sampling algorithms (Metropolis-Hastings and Slice Sampler) can significantly decrease the computational expense compared to using either sampler alone. The statistics of the stochastic inversion allow for (1) variances that better reveal the measurement sensitivities of the two different electromagnetic techniques than traditional techniques and (2) models defined by the median and modes of parameter probability density functions, which produce amplitude and phase data that are consistent with the observed data. In general, parameter error estimates from the covariance matrix significantly underestimate the true parameter error, whereas the parameter variance derived from Markov chains accurately encompass the error.",10.1190/geo2010-0223.1
Three-Dimensional Gravity Inversion Using Graph Theory To Delineate The Skeleton Of Homogeneous Sources,"We developed a new strategy, based on graph theory concepts, to invert gravity data using an ensemble of simple point masses. Our method consisted of a genetic algorithm with elitism to generate a set of possible solutions. Each estimate was associated to a graph to solve the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem. To produce unique and stable estimates, we restricted the position of the point masses by minimizing the statistical variance of the distances of an MST jointly with the data-misfit function during the iterations of the genetic algorithm. Hence, the 3D spatial distribution of the point masses identified the skeleton of homogeneous gravity sources. In addition, our method also gave an estimation of the anomalous mass of the source. So, together with the anomalous mass, the skeleton could aid other 3D methods with promising geometric a priori parameters. Several tests with different values of regularizing parameter were made to bespeak this new regularizing strategy. The inversion results applied to noise-corrupted synthetic gravity data revealed that, regardless of promising starting models, the estimated distribution of point masses and the anomalous mass offered valuable information about the homogeneous sources in the subsurface. Tests on real data from a portion of Quadrilátero Ferrífero, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, were performed for complementary analysis of the proposed inversion method.",10.1190/geo2014-0250.1
Linearized Least‐Squares Method For Interpretation Of Potential‐Field Data From Sources Of Simple Geometry,"We present a new method for interpreting isolated potential‐field (gravity and magnetic) anomaly data. A linear equation, involving a symmetric anomalous field and its horizontal gradient, is derived to provide both the depth and nature of the buried sources. In many currently available methods, either higher order derivatives or postprocessing is necessary to extract both pieces of information; therefore, data must be of very high quality. In contrast, for gravity work with our method, only a first‐order horizontal derivative is needed and the traditional data quality is sufficient. Our proposed method is similar to the Euler technique; it uses a shape factor instead of a structural index to characterize the buried sources. The method is tested using theoretical anomaly data with and without random noise. In all cases, the method adequately estimates the location and the approximate shape of the source. The practical utility of the method is demonstrated using gravity and magnetic field examples from the United States and Zimbabwe.",10.1190/1.1759464
Fresnel-Zone Binning: Fresnel-Zone Shape With Offset And Velocity Function,"The concept of the Fresnel zone has been explored by many workers; most commonly, their work has involved examining the Fresnel zone in the limiting case of zero offset and constant velocity. I have examined the shape of the Fresnel zone for nonzero offset and in the situation of constant velocity gradient. Finite-offset Fresnel zones are not circular but are elliptical and may be many times larger than their zero-offset equivalents. My derivation takes a largely geometric approach, and I suggest a useful approximation for the dimension of the Fresnel zone parallel to the shot-receiver azimuth. The presence of a velocity gradient (velocity increasing with depth) in the subsurface leads to an expansion of the Fresnel zone to an area that is far larger than may be determined through a more usual straight-ray determination.",10.1190/1.3294576
Simultaneous Correction For Divergence And Deconvolution Without Changing Industrial Practice,"In 1978 Mendel and Kormylo (see, also, Kormylo and Mendel, 1980; and Mendel, 1983) proposed a technique for simultaneously correcting for spherical divergence and performing deconvolution. We showed that when the traditional starting point for deconvolution, namely, the convolutional sum model of a seismogram, is cast into state‐variable format, so that deconvolution can be performed by Kalman filtering and optimal smoothing techniques, e.g., minimum‐variance deconvolution (MVD) or maximum‐likelihood deconvolution (MLD), then one should not make the commonly made divergence correction on the data. Instead, that correction, which is a time‐varying one, should be put into the state‐variable model for deconvolution. This is possible because MVD and MLD are applicable to time‐varying and/or nonstationary systems.",10.1190/1.1441694
Traveltime Inversion Using Transmitted Waves Of Offset Vsp Data,"Estimation of layer parameters such as interval velocity, reflector depth, and dip can be formulated as a generalized linear inverse problem using observed arrival times. Based on a 2-D earth model, a computationally efficient and accurate formula is derived for traveltime inversion. This inversion method is applied to offset vertical seismic profile (VSP) data for estimating layer parameters using only transmitted first‐arrival times. As opposed to a layer‐stripping method, this method estimates all layer parameters simultaneously, thus reducing the cumulative error resulting from the errors in the upper layers. This investigation indicates (1) at least two source locations are required to estimate layer parameters properly, and (2) accurate arrival times are essential for computing the dip of a layer reliably. Bulk time shifts, such as static shifts, do not affect the parameter estimation significantly if the amount of shift is not too large. The result of real and modeled VSP data inversions indicates that traveltime inversion using transmitted first‐arrival times from at least two source locations is a viable method for estimating interval velocities, reflector depths, and reflector dips.",10.1190/1.1442920
A Comparison Of Ip Electrode Arrays,"The responses of dipole‐dipole, pole‐dipole, and gradient arrays to a set of ten structures have been computed using the finite element method. Comparison of the responses indicates that: (1) The dipole‐dipole array usually gives the largest anomalies, but the anomalies rarely give information on dip of a structure and are strongly influenced by overburden irregularities. This array gives best overall resolution. (2) Pole‐dipole anomalies are almost as large as dipole‐dipole ones and have the same general form but show less resolution. The lower resolution and the asymmetry of this array make results more difficult to interpret. (3) The gradient array provides dip information and good horizontal resolution. Responses to thin vertical structures are weak, anomalies are strongly affected by overburden irregularities, and there is no effective depth discrimination.",10.1190/1.1440372
Concepts Of Normal And Dip Moveout,"Both normal moveout and dip moveout are key elements of modern seismic data processing. A nonmathematical discussion of the nature and action of these processes helps to clarify their importance. Special emphasis is given to their history and geometry, as well as the effect of dip, velocity variation, and anisotropy. The relationship between dip moveout and prestack migration is also developed.",10.1190/1.1444669
Separating Quasi-P-Wave In Transversely Isotropic Media With A Vertical Symmetry Axis By Synthesized Pressure Applied To Ocean-Bottom Seismic Data Elastic Reverse Time Migration,"Quasi-P (qP)-wavefield separation is a crucial step for elastic P-wave imaging in anisotropic media. It is, however, notoriously challenging to quickly and accurately obtain separated qP-wavefields. Based on the concepts of the trace of the stress tensor and the pressure fields defined in isotropic media, we have developed a new method to rapidly separate the qP-wave in a transversely isotropic medium with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI) by synthesized pressure from ocean-bottom seismic (OBS) data as a preprocessing step for elastic reverse time migration (ERTM). Another key aspect of OBS data elastic wave imaging is receiver-side 4C records back extrapolation. Recent studies have revealed that receiver-side tensorial extrapolation in isotropic media with ocean-bottom 4C records can sufficiently suppress nonphysical waves produced during receiver-side reverse time wavefield extrapolation. Similarly, the receiver-side 4C records tensorial extrapolation was extended to ERTM in VTI media in our studies. Combining a separated qP-wave by synthesizing pressure and receiver-side wavefield reverse time tensorial extrapolation with the crosscorrelation imaging condition, we have developed a robust, fast, flexible, and elastic imaging quality improved method in VTI media for OBS data.",10.1190/geo2016-0108.1
The Effect Of Shotpoint Medium On Seismic Coupling,"Two experiments on the coupling of seismic waves to the surrounding medium have been conducted. One was performed at two different overburden depths in a tunnel complex at the Nevada Test Site in the Oak Spring Tuff. The other was done at a depth of 800 ft in the Carey Salt Mine at the Winnfield Salt Dome near Winnfield, Louisiana. Free‐field measurements within 400 ft of the chemical charges indicate that three to four times more energy was propagated into the elastic zone in the tuff than in the salt. There is some indication that in tuff the amount of energy transmitted into the elastic zone was dependent upon the lithostatic overburden pressure. Increasing the overburden pressure by a factor of about five almost quadrupled the energy propagated into the elastic zone.",10.1190/1.1438955
Geophysical History Of Typical Mississippi Piercement Salt Domes,"Maps and cross sections are given, showing the development of geophysical and geological knowledge of the New Home and D'Lo domes. Both are shallow, piercement domes in the northern part of the Mississippi salt dome basin. Both were first indicated by gravity surveys, the shallow cap‐rock checked by refraction seismograph surveys, cap‐rock depths checked by drilling and further seismograph work and drilling then carried out to determine the position of the salt and the attitude of the sediments. The successive items of geophysical work and test drilling have led to a consistent and orderly development of information about these domes. An additional note is included, with three pairs of gravity maps, showing how strong and definite, but very local, gravity expressions of shallow domes may be missed by reconnaissance surveys.",10.1190/1.1437293
Inversion = Migration + Tomography,"Seismic inversion, broadly enough defined, is equivalent to doing migration and reflection tomography simultaneously. Diffraction tomography and inversion work best when sources and receivers surround the region of interest, as in medical imaging applications. Theoretical studies have shown that high vertical wavenumber velocity perturbations are resolved by inverting surface seismic reflection data, but the low vertical wavenumbers must be obtained using a separate step, such as velocity analysis or reflection tomography. I propose that a nonlinear iterative inversion that updates a varying background velocity obtains all wavenumbers that are resolvable separately by migration and tomography. The background velocity must contain reflectors to provide data on both upward and downward transmission paths through the earth and hence the low wavenumbers. By considering the downward transmission paths to be between surface sources and buried image geophones and the upward transmission paths to be between surface geophones and buried image sources, the source and receiver coverage is effectively the same as in medical imaging; although the depth of the image sources and geophones must be determined in the inversion by finding the reflector depths. Synthetic examples verify the theoretical predictions and show that reflector locations and interval velocities can be obtained simultaneously even when there is no prior knowledge of reflector location. However, a good initial ""very low‐wavenumber"" model is normally required to ensure convergence to the global inverse solution.",10.1190/1.1442625
Seismic Trace Interpolation Using Half‐Step Prediction Filters,"A method to perform seismic trace interpolation known as the Spitz method handles spatially aliased events. The Spitz method uses the unit‐step prediction filter to estimate data spaced at Δx/2. The missing data are obtained by solving a complex linear system of equations whose unknowns are the coefficients at the interpolated location. We attack this problem by introducing a half‐step prediction filter that makes trace interpolation significantly more efficient and easier for implementation. A complex half‐step prediction filter at frequency f/2 is computed in the least‐squares sense to predict odd data components from even ones. At the frequency f, the prediction operator is shrunk and convolved with the input data spaced at Δx to predict data at Δx/2 directly. Instead of solving two systems of linear equations, as proposed by Spitz, only a system for the half‐step prediction filter has to be solved. Numerical examples using a marine seismic common‐midpoint (CMP) gather and a poststack seismic section were used to illustrate the new interpolation method.",10.1190/1.1444650
"Geophysical History Of Parentis Oil Field, France","In 1951, the French Government granted an exclusive exploration permit to the Esso R.E.P. (a Standard Oil Company affiliate) over an area of 4,357,980 acres around Bordeaux in the northern part of the Aquitaine Basin, France. This area was investigated first by surface geology; then it was surveyed by the gravity meter. In checking the gravity anomalies by the reflection seismograph, a subsurface structure was found at Parentis in 1953, which was drilled in 1954, and was proved to be oil bearing. The Parentis oil field is the most important oil field, not only in France, but in all Europe outside the Iron Curtain. Gravity map, seismograph map, seismic profiles, telluric map and geological contour maps, and cross sections of the Parentis structure are presented.",10.1190/1.1438279
Peg‐Leg Multiples And Dipping Reflectors,"When seismic reflections, whether primaries or multiples, are collected in CDP gathers, their curves are hyperbolas with the smallest value of time corresponding to coincident source and detector (SGD = 0). We have discovered an exception to this rule. If one of the reflecting interfaces dips, some of the peg‐leg multiples have hyperbolic time‐distance curves with heads at SGD's other than zero. Furthermore, sets of peg‐legs which have the same traveltime when all interfaces are horizontal split into distinct events when their raypaths involve at least one dipping interface. The members of a set have different apparent stacking velocities—some higher and some lower than the stacking velocities for multiples that are not peg‐legs. Raypaths for a peg‐leg generally leave a source and arrive at a detector at angles which are not the same. We derive equations expressing the time‐distance behavior of peg‐legs for systems made up of beds differing in density but not interval velocity. We also consider models with varying interval velocities and show CDP data generated with a computer and stacked subsequently. Peg‐leg reduction by stacking suffers because of the several velocities for each peg‐leg set. It appears that when a subsurface includes dipping reflectors, peg‐legs may be an important source of noise.",10.1190/1.1440775
An Analysis Of The Observed Time Discrepancies Between Continuous And Conventional Well Velocity Surveys,"Discrepancies between conventionally obtained times and the integrated continuous velocity curves are analyzed (Shell tool only). It is found that these discrepancies may be ascribed to a random scatter and a systematic deviation, the integrated continuous curves being short. Possible causes of these discrepancies are discussed but no final explanation can be offered.",10.1190/1.1438837
Cascaded Migrations: Improving The Accuracy Of Finite‐Difference Migration,"The accuracy of time migrations done with finite‐difference schemes deteriorates with increasing reflector dip. Some properties of migration in general, and of finite‐difference approaches in particular, suggest a way of improving the accuracy of finite‐difference schemes for migrating steep dips. First, although data will be undermigrated when too low a velocity is used in migration, a correctly migrated result can be obtained by migrating again, this time with the previously undermigrated result as input. In fact, a sequence of undermigrations will yield the correct result as long as the sum of the squares of the migration velocities used in the different migration stages equals the square of the correct migration velocity. A second property is that the apparent spatial dip of a reflector perceived by the migration process is a function of not only the time dip of the unmigrated reflection, but also the velocity used in the migration. In a sequence of low‐velocity migrations, the apparent spatial dip perceived at each migration stage can be considerably less than the true dip. Thus, because finite‐difference migration is accurate for small spatial dips, the cascaded migrations yield a more accurate result than that of single‐stage migration. Also, because each migration stage is done with low velocity, the depth step can be large; hence, the computational effort need not be. The accuracy of the method is not compromised (in fact, it improves) in media in which velocity increases with depth. Moreover, the cascaded approach suffers no more than other methods of time migration where velocity varies mildly in the lateral direction. In applications of the method to stacked data from the Gulf of Mexico, reflections from near‐vertical flanks of salt domes were migrated with accuracy comparable to that achieved by frequency‐wavenumber domain migration.",10.1190/1.1442331
Some Applications Of Linear Programming To The Inverse Gravity Problem,"An approach is presented for solving the inverse gravity problem in the presence of various constraints such as bounds on density. This approach takes into account the nonuniqueness of the solution: for a finite set of measurements, the region studied is divided into a great number of rectangular prisms of unknown density. The set of all solutions of this undetermined problem may be described through various convex diagrams of moments; plots of these moments give bounds on some physical parameters such as the partial and total mass or the position of the center of mass. Numerical solutions are obtained using linear programming algorithms. Also, particular solutions such as the so‐called ideal body may readily be obtained using this technique. Only two‐dimensional cylindrical structures are considered, but application of this technique to three‐dimensional bodies is straight‐forward.",10.1190/1.1440786
Southwestern Oklahoma—A Geophysical Case History Of A Basin,"The Eastern Palo Duro Basin, also known as the Hollis, Harmon, or Hardeman Basin, covers approximately 100 townships in southwestern Oklahoma. Approximately 18 million barrels of oil have been produced from the Altus and West Frederick trends in Jackson and Tillman Counties. The basin's structure has been influenced by three orogenic movements: the Acadian, Wichita, and Arbuckle. Dips associated with the main Wichita structures show displacements up to 2,500 ft. Seismograph surveys have played a major part in the development of the basin. The main problems encountered are related to the surface and near‐surface material of the Quaternary deposits and the Permian Blaine Formation. The unconsolidated sands and gravels of the Quaternary deposits are particularly troublesome along the main branches of the Red River. Generally, record quality can be improved with two‐ and three‐hole patterns. The Blaine gypsum and Dog Creek shale, considered as a single unit, outcrop in the western half of the basin. Difficult drilling problems require two or three combination air‐water drills for efficient field operations. Correction problems are compounded by variations in the weathering velocity from 2,000 ft/sec to 3,850 ft/sec and in the near‐surface velocity from 8,000 ft/sec to 12,500 ft/sec. Record quality can be improved in the western area by using multiple geophone coverage, by placing the charge entirely within a shale zone, by using patterns, and by careful selection of the surface traverse to avoid gypsum outcrops. The ""VIBROSEIS"" system produces better data than the conventional method. Other advantages of the ""VIBROSEIS"" system are easier permitting and a great reduction of explosives and shothole drilling. While it is unlikely that major producing trends comparable to Altus and West Frederick remain to be found, it is concluded that adequate reservoirs are present and that there is ample room for structures comparable to Conley field in adjacent Hardeman County, Texas. By careful application of suitable seismic field techniques such structures can be reliably mapped.",10.1190/1.1439455
A Brief History Of Seismic Migration,"In this article, I attempt to focus on the chronology of seismic imaging. I start in the mid-1920s, progress through the human ""computer""-based methods of the 1940s and 1950s, discuss the emergence of digital wave-equation technology in the 1960s and early 1970s, and finally end with a review of the present. I include a bit of speculation about the future of seismic imaging, but the meat of the article is on seismic-imaging history. Based on the timing of their publications, I claim there are three key contributors to the theoretical developments of modern seismic imaging: F. Rieber, J. G. Hagedoorn, and  J. F. Claerbout. None of these men were the first to consider the seismic-imaging problem, but their papers and algorithms have probably been quoted more often than anyone else's. One certainly must give credit as well to C. H. Dix and M. M. Slotnick for similar contributions. Other names that come to mind include Hans Sattlegger in Germany, A. J. Berkhout in the Netherlands, Bill Schneider at GSI in Dallas, and Robert Stolt at CONOCO in Ponca City, Oklahoma. However, without the independent computational progression predicted by Moore's law (computer speed doubles every 18 months), the spectacular subsurface images produced today would not be possible. I hope to convince the reader that in addition to the development of the vast literature on seismic-imaging theory, another, less-publicized, parallel technological progression has focused on the development of efficient machines to produce, with minimal human intervention, an increasingly more accurate image of the strata below the recording instruments. Unfortunately, with a few key exceptions, the names of many of the contributors to this aspect of seismic imaging have been lost. The digital revolution in the 1960s appears to be the culmination of this attempt at mechanization, but not until the development of truly powerful scientific computers did the more accurate and advanced theoretical developments in seismic-imaging theory become practical to apply and use in the search for diminishing supplies of hydrocarbons. In fact, one can argue that we still don't have sufficient computer power to do everything we need and want to do. But that's another story.",10.1190/1.1926579
"Geophysical History Of The La Gloria Field, Jim Wells And Brooks Counties, Texas","This paper presents a historical record of the geophysical activity in the area of the La Gloria Field. The successive stages of geophysical exploration were: Torsion balance survey 1934–1935; correlation reflection seismograph survey 1936; dip reflection seismograph survey, 1938; correlation reflection seismograph survey, 1938; gravity meter survey, 1943–1944. The discovery well, Magnolia's Sam Maun No. 1, was drilled and completed in 1938–1939, producing initially 165 barrels per day of 65° gravity distillate and 5,646,000 cubic feet of gas through a 5/16 inch choke. Oil and gas in the La Gloria Field are being produced from sands in the Frio formation of Oligocene age. There are a number of sands producing gas‐distillate. Several flank wells produce oil. The field has been unitized and a cycling plant is engaged in processing the gas‐distillate.",10.1190/1.1437248
A Passive Seismic Survey Over A Gas Field: Analysis Of Low-Frequency Anomalies,"Passive seismic low-frequency (from approximately   1–6 Hz  ) data have been acquired at several locations around the world. Spectra calculated from these data, acquired over fields with known hydrocarbon accumulations, show common spectral anomalies. Verification of whether these anomalies are common to only a few, many, or all hydrocarbon reservoirs can be provided only if more and detailed results are reported. An extensive survey was carried out above a tight gas reservoir and an adjacent exploration area in Mexico. Data from several hundred stations with three-component broadband seismometers distributed over approximately   200  km2    were used for the analysis. Severalhydrocarbon reservoir-related microtremor attributes were calculated, and mapped attributes were compared with known gas intervals, with good agreement. Wells drilled after the survey confirm a predicted high hydrocarbon potential in the exploration area. A preliminary model was developed to explain the source mechanism of those microtremors. Poroelastic effects caused by wave-induced fluid flow and oscillations of different fluid phases are significant processes in the low-frequency range that can modify the omnipresent seismic background spectrum. These processes only occur in partially saturated rocks. We assume that hydrocarbon reservoirs are partially saturated, whereas the surrounding rocks are fully saturated. Our real data observations are consistent with this conceptual model.",10.1190/1.3078402
Shear-Wave Group-Velocity Surfaces In Low-Symmetry Anisotropic Media,"Shear waves excited by natural sources constitute a significant part of useful energy recorded in downhole microseismic surveys. In rocks, such as fractured shales, exhibiting symmetries lower than transverse isotropy (TI), the shear wavefronts are always multivalued in certain directions, potentially complicating the data processing and analysis. This paper discusses a basic tool — the computation of the phase and group velocities of all waves propagating along a given ray — that intends to facilitate the understanding of geometries of the shear wavefronts in homogeneous anisotropic media. With this tool, arbitrarily complex group-velocity surfaces can be conveniently analyzed, providing insights into possible challenges to be faced when processing shear waves in anisotropic velocity models that have symmetries lower than TI. Among those challenges are complicated multipathing and the presence of cones of directions, known as internal refraction cones, in which no fast shear waves propagate and the entire shear portion of the body-wave seismic data consists of several branches of the slow shear wavefronts.",10.1190/geo2014-0156.1
Studies In Non‐Structural Petroleum Prospecting I. A Non‐Structural Working Hypothesis For Petroleum Prospecting,"A non‐structural (i.e., more general than structural) working hypothesis, with a potential usefulness greater than that of the currently accepted geophysical structural working hypothesis, is proposed for petroleum prospecting. This non‐structural working hypothesis postulates that an observable anomaly, with potential significance in petroleum prospecting, may originate not only in lithologic structure (the significant structural anomaly), but also in stratigraphic variations in (primary) lithology associated with the presence of petroleum accumulation (the significant stratigraphic anomaly). Thereby, a gradation in types of significant anomalies is anticipated, from the significant structural to the significant stratigraphic anomaly, depending upon the relative magnitudes of structural and stratigraphic effects. Two sub‐hypotheses are formulated, the special structural and the special stratigraphic, which are applicable, respectively, to the resolution of the significant structural and the significant stratigraphic anomalies. An examination of the corollaries from the hypotheses at issue (the currently accepted geophysical structural and the proposed non‐structural) indicates that one critical test depends upon the identification of four unique (i.e., unfamiliar) characteristics postulated for the near‐surface significant stratigraphic anomaly; these are magnitude at a shallow depth of survey, configuration, orientation of maximum expression, and change in configuration with depth of survey.",10.1190/1.1437690
Anisotropic Velocity Analysis For Lithology Discrimination,"A new velocity analysis technique is presented for analyzing moveout of signals on multichannel surface seismic or VSP data. An approximate, skewed hyperbolic moveout formula is derived for horizontally layered, transversely isotropic media. This formula involves three measurement parameters: the average vertical velocity and horizontal and skew moveout velocities. By extending Dix‐type hyperbolic moveout analysis, we obtain improved coherence over large source‐geophone offsets for more accurate moveout correction. Compared with the stacking velocity obtained by simple hyperbolic analysis methods, the three velocity parameters estimated by this technique contain more physically meaningful geologic information regarding the anisotropy and/or velocity heterogeneity of the subsurface. Synthetic P‐wave model experiments demonstrate that the skewed hyperbolic moveout formula yields an excellent fit to time‐distance curves over a wide range of ray angles. Consequently, the measurement parameters are shown to reflect adequately the characteristics of velocity dependence on ray angle, i.e., velocity anisotropy. The technique is then applied to two field offset VSP data sets to measure and analyze the velocity parameters. The results show that the apparent anisotropy, defined as the ratio between the horizontal moveout velocity and average vertical velocity, correlates reasonably well with lithology. Highly anisotropic shale and chalk exhibit higher horizontal‐to‐vertical velocity ratios and sandstones show lower ratios.",10.1190/1.1442624
Anisotropic Parsimonious Prestack Depth Migration,"An efficient Kirchhoff-style prestack depth migration, called ""parsimonious"" migration, was developed a decade ago for isotropic 2D and 3D media by using measured slownesses to reduce the amount of ray tracing by orders of magnitude. It is conceptually similar to ""map"" migration, but its implementation has some differences. We have extended this approach to 2D tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) media and illustrated it with synthetic P-wave data. Although the framework of isotropic parsimonious may be retained, the extension to TTI media requires redevelopment of each of the numerical components, calculation of the phase and group velocity for TTI media, development of a new two-point anisotropic ray tracer, and substitution of an initial-angle isotropic shooting ray-trace algorithm for an anisotropic one. The model parameterization consists of Thomsen's parameters (VP0, ε, δ) and the tilt angle of the symmetry axis of the TI medium. The parsimonious anisotropic migration algorithm is successfully applied to synthetic data from a TTI version of the Marmousi2 model. The quality of the image improves by weighting the impulse response by the calculation of the anisotropic Fresnel radius. The accuracy and speed of this migration makes it useful for anisotropic velocity model building. The elapsed computing time for 101 shots for the Marmousi2 TTI model is 35 s per shot (each with 501 traces) in 32 Opteron cores.",10.1190/geo2011-0408.1
"Seismic Monitoring Of The Growth Of A Hydraulic Fracture Zone At Fenton Hill, New Mexico","The hydraulic fracturing technique is an important method for enhancing hydrocarbon recovery, geothermal energy extraction, and solid waste disposal. Determination of the geometry and growth process of a hydraulic fracture zone is important for monitoring and assessing subsurface fractures. A relative‐source‐location approach, based on a waveform correlation and a grid search method, has been developed to estimate relative hypocenter locations for a cluster of 157 microearthquakes induced by hydraulic fracturing at the Los Alamos Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal site. Among the 157 events, 147 microearthquakes occurred in a tight cluster with a dimension of 40 m, roughly defining a vertical hydraulic fracture zone with an orientation of N40°W. The length, height, and width of the hydraulic fracture zone are estimated to be 40, 35, and 5 m, respectively. Analysis of the spatial‐temporal pattern of the induced microearthquakes reveals that the fracture zone grew significantly, averaging 0.2 m/minute in a two‐hour period toward the northwest along the fracture zone strike.",10.1190/1.1444304
Borehole Transmission Tomography For Velocity Plus Statics,"The accuracy of velocity tomograms reconstructed from borehole transmission traveltime data is highly sensitive to traveltime statics. We present a least‐squares tomography algorithm that includes a traveltime static term. The algorithm solves for both the velocity field and the traveltime statics simultaneously. This enables us to separate traveltime signal from traveltime noise, reducing the tomographic velocity artifacts caused by the statics. The incorporation of a priori constraints on the poorly determined spectral components of the velocity field further improves accuracy by reducing velocity artifacts as a result of uneven ray coverage. Application of the algorithm to numerical crosswell data results in velocity and statics' estimates that are accurate to within 1 percent. Application of the algorithm to Exxon's Friendswood tomography data results in velocity and statics' estimates that correlate with independent data.",10.1190/1.1443659
Algorithms For Removing Surface Water Signals From Surface Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Infiltration Surveys,"Surface nuclear magnetic resonance (surface NMR) is a geophysical method that directly detects water and can be used to determine the depth profile of water content within the subsurface. Although surface NMR has proven useful for investigating groundwater in the saturated zone, its use to study the vadose zone is still in development. A recent study for the South Avra Valley Storage and Recovery Project (SAVSARP) demonstrated that surface NMR can be used to monitor infiltrating water associated with aquifer storage and recovery, a water resource management method in which surface water is stored in local aquifers during wet periods for use during dry periods. However, one of the major issues associated with using surface NMR to monitor infiltrating water is the influence of large bodies of surface water. We have examined the effect that large bodies of surface water have on the surface NMR signal, and we have developed three algorithms (the a priori, late-signal, and long-signal-inversion [LSI] algorithms) to remove this signal. Using synthetic data sets, we have assessed the efficacy of each algorithm and determined that, although each algorithm is capable of suppressing the signal from a water layer with a thickness ≤5  m, the LSI algorithm provides the most accurate and consistent results. Using a field example from the SAVSARP survey, we have evaluated the use of the LSI algorithm to suppress the surface water signal. Our results have indicated that the signal from surface water detected in a surface NMR survey can be suppressed to obtain the subsurface water content without the use of new measurement techniques or additional equipment.",10.1190/geo2015-0386.1
Automated Source‐Edge Location With A New Variable Pass‐Band Horizontal‐Gradient Operator,"A new class of space‐domain convolution operators permits computation of the components of the horizontal gradient of gridded potential‐field data. These so‐called gradient‐component operators allow one to vary the passband and thus control the frequency content of the resulting horizontal‐gradient map. This facilitates computation of gradient maps that accommodate data of widely varying frequency content. Examination of the transfer functions of these operators suggests that this method of numerical differentiation is well suited to potential‐field data: in particular, the operators suppress long wavelengths and highfrequency noise bands and amplify signal. Maps of the horizontal gradient of certain potential fields (e.g., gravity, pseudogravity) may be combined with algorithms that locate relative maxima, so‐called thresholding, to automate the procedure of source‐body edge detection, which is a useful tool in mapping, for example, basement grain, fault patterns, and igneous intrusive bodies. We apply this new operator, together with an existing thresholding algorithm, to a field example from western Canada and demonstrate its potential for improved imaging of the horizontal‐gradient magnitude and thus improved edge detection.",10.1190/1.1443615
Numerical Modeling Of Refraction Arrivals In Complex Areas,"Use of refracted arrivals to delineate near‐surface complex structure can sometimes be difficult because of rapid lateral changes in the refraction event along the line of control. The interpreter must correlate over zones of interference and zones of weak signal. During correlation it is often difficult to stay on the correct cycle of the waveform. We present a method to model refracted arrivals numerically in an area where these problems occur. The computation combines plane‐wave field decomposition to calculate propagation in complex regions with a WKBJ method to calculate propagation in simple regions. To illustrate the method, we study a case where the near‐surface complex structure is caused by the presence of low‐velocity gaseous mud. The modeling produces synthetic seismograms showing the interference patterns and changes in intensity that are seen in real data. This modeling shows how correlations may be done over difficult areas, particularly where cycle skips can occur.",10.1190/1.1441840
Intelligent Meshing Technique For 2D Resistivity Inverse Problems,"In geophysical inverse problems, an a priori structured mesh is often used for inversion and mesh refinement is applied if needed by the user after observation of inversion results. We have developed a new intelligent self-adaptive unstructured finite-element meshing technique for electrical resistivity tomography inverse problems. This new approach uses Harris corner-and-edge detectors that are based on the local autocorrelation function of 2D distribution of pixels. This meshing technique optimizes the size of the inverse problem by refining areas where variations in the physical property structure are sensed to be important. The meshing technique also generates a more appropriate and optimum mesh for the inverse problem that is dependent on the problem itself. Tests on modeled data have demonstrated that the proposed intelligent meshing technique can reduce data misfit, produce a better reconstruction of the true physical properties, and minimize the size of the inverse problem. The synthetic model consists of a conductive dike in a resistive medium. By applying the proposed intelligent meshing technique, the inverse model of the dike is very similar to the inverse model produced using fine meshes, and it is also better reconstructed than the inverse model produced using conventional meshes. We have also applied the intelligent meshing technique to survey data collected for groundwater-saltwater mapping and characterizing the subsurface conductive structure with topography included. Our results indicate that the new meshing technique can produce solutions that are comparable with standard meshing and fine meshing techniques, while optimizing the size of the inverse problem.",10.1190/geo2015-0177.1
Model Studies Of Shallow Common‐Offset Seismic Data,"For simplicity, optimum‐window common‐offset data‐acquisition procedures are frequently employed to collect near‐surface, high‐resolution, seismic reflection data. However, because of large incidence angles, interpretations of the data often cannot be evaluated accurately using zero‐offset simulations alone. Common‐offset hammer seismic data collected in the central Appalachian plateau province of West Virginia are examined in this paper. Synthetic shot records using a minimum‐phase wavelet estimated from the data and subsurface acoustic properties derived from full‐waveform and other geophysical logs are used to simulate the offset seismic response of near‐surface, coal‐bearing Pennsylvanian aged rocks. Zoeppritz equations are used to model amplitudes. This study indicates that offset simulations may be required to determine the origins of events observed at a given offset. Offset simulations also help determine whether amplitude variations with offset have a significant effect on the appearance of events observed at the optimum offset. The offset seismic response is significantly different from the zero‐offset response for reflections arising from depths less than about two‐thirds of the offset distance; for greater depths, zero‐offset simulations adequately approximate the offset response.",10.1190/1.1442848
Crustal Modeling From Spectrally Correlated Free‐Air And Terrain Gravity Data—A Case Study Of Ohio,"We investigate the use of spectral correlation theory to analyze terrain gravity effects and free‐air gravity anomalies of Ohio for possible constraints on the thickness variations and neotectonics of the crust. Terrain gravity effects are computed from the topography by Gauss‐Legendre quadrature integration and are compared against independent free‐air gravity anomaly observations for their wavenumber correlation spectrum. Spectral correlation filters are designed accordingly to extract terrain‐correlated free‐air gravity anomalies that are subtracted from the terrain gravity effects for estimates of the compensated terrain gravity effects. These effects are used to model the Moho by inversion, assuming they predominantly reflect crustal thickness variations. Our results characterize the middle third of Ohio as a broad zone of thickened Precambrian crust, which also may include rifted regions where the thickness of the prerift crust has been reduced greatly. Furthermore, we find that about 83% of the instrumentally determined earthquake epicenters are located within the inferred thinner regions of Ohio's crust or at their margins where compressional stresses may dominate. In general, these crustal thickness variations provide new constraints on modeling the tectonic evolution and geotechnical parameters of the crust—constraints that are important for evaluating earthquake hazards, the distribution and extraction of crustal resources, and the storage of hazardous waste and other crustal engineering applications.",10.1190/1.1444799
An Electrical Model For The Sub‐Icelandic Crust,"Active resistivity and magnetotelluric experiments in southwest Iceland suggest typical resistivities for the crust of 10 to 100 ohm‐m. These low crustal resistivities are compared with calculations on the expected resistivity of fluid‐saturated crustal rocks for plausible ranges of temperature, pore‐pressure, and water chemistry. The comparison of the synthetic models with actual field data suggests: (1) The suppression of resistivity at shallow depth is caused by regional hydrothermal activity. (2) Appreciable effects from water are obtained from depths to 8 or 10 km. (3) Below 10 km the effects from conduction along electrolytic paths are probably dominated by conduction in the solid rock itself.",10.1190/1.1440332
Solution Of The Fundamental Problem In Resistivity Logging With A Hybrid Method,"The fundamental resistivity logging problem of a resistivity tool in the presence of both vertical and horizontal boundaries is solved with a hybrid method. The hybrid method combines the mode concept in waveguide theory together with the finite‐element method. In the mathematical formulation, the horizontal boundaries are used to separate the geometry of the problem into different regions. In each region, the waveguide modes are obtained through the solution of an equivalent variational problem. The solutions are calculated by a one‐dimensional finite‐element method. The vertical boundaries are taken into account in these calculations. The orthonormality of modes in each region allows a series representation of the potential in the regions. Boundary conditions at horizontal bed boundaries then couple the modes between different regions and enable the solutions for the potential to be expressed in terms of reflection and transmission matrices of modes. The source excitation determines the amplitudes of the modes. The results of the hybrid method are in excellent agreement with those of the integral transform solution. Numerical results of the apparent resistivity are illustrated as a function of formation properties. The effects of an invaded zone are also examined by considering radial inhomogeneous profiles in the formation. The results of the hybrid method are numerically efficient because it reduces the two‐dimensional finite‐element problem into a one‐dimensional one. It also provides a physical interpretation of the solution in terms of modes.",10.1190/1.1441568
Source Separation For Simultaneous Towed-Streamer Marine Acquisition — A Compressed Sensing Approach,"Simultaneous marine acquisition is an economic way to sample seismic data and speed up acquisition, wherein single or multiple source vessels fire sources at near-simultaneous or slightly random times, resulting in overlapping shot records. The current paradigm for simultaneous towed-streamer marine acquisition incorporates ""low variability"" in source firing times, i.e., 0≤1 or 2 s because the sources and receivers are moving. This results in a low degree of randomness in simultaneous data, which is challenging to separate (into its constituent sources) using compressed-sensing-based separation techniques because randomization is key to successful recovery via compressed sensing. We have addressed the challenge of source separation for simultaneous towed-streamer acquisitions via two compressed-sensing-based approaches, i.e., sparsity promotion and rank minimization. We have evaluated the performance of the sparsity-promotion- and rank-minimization-based techniques by simulating two simultaneous towed-streamer acquisition scenarios, i.e., over/under and simultaneous long offset. A field data example from the Gulf of Suez for the over/under acquisition scenario was also developed. We observed that the proposed approaches gave good and comparable recovery qualities of the separated sources, but the rank-minimization technique outperformed the sparsity-promoting technique in terms of the computational time and memory. We also compared these two techniques with the normal-moveout-based median-filtering-type approach, which had comparable results.",10.1190/geo2015-0108.1
Anisotropic Geometrical-Spreading Correction For Wide-Azimuth P-Wave Reflections,"In combination with the nonhyperbolic moveout inversion, we apply our method to wide-azimuth P-wave data collected at the Weyburn field in Canada. The geometrical-spreading factor for the reflection from the top of the fractured reservoir is clearly influenced by azimuthal anisotropy in the overburden, which should cause distortions in the azimuthal AVO attributes. This case study confirms that the azimuthal variation of the geometrical-spreading factor often is comparable to or exceeds that of the reflection coefficient.",10.1190/1.2335615
Transformation Of Vlf Data Into Apparent Resistivities And Phases,"In the VLF method, the ratio between the vertical and the horizontal magnetic field or the total magnetic field anomaly is measured to detect localized changes in electrical conductivity contrasts. Although the VLF technique has probably been the most popular electromagnetic (EM) tool for mapping near‐surface geological structures in a large scale for the past few decades because of the low cost and speed with which surveys can be carried out, the measurements themselves do not give a direct estimate of electrical conductivity. A fast iterative method has been developed to estimate the impedance or apparent resistivity and phases from measurements of the magnetic components at the surface of a 2-D geological structure. From Maxwell's equations in E-polarization, a relation was derived between the horizontal and vertical components of the magnetic field. A full solution has been obtained by making use of the fact that the secondary horizontal and vertical magnetic fields are of internal origin and form a Hilbert transform pair. Synthetic and real VLF data have been used to evaluate the performance and limitation of the method. Using synthetic and real data, one can achieve a full recovery of the E-polarization impedance as long as the length of the profile is sufficiently long. A number of precautions must be taken to ensure reliable estimation of impedance results.",10.1190/1.1444644
2-D Acoustic Wave Equation Inversion Combining Plane‐Wave Seismograms With Well Logs,Seismic waves can be described approximately by an acoustic wave equation. An inversion procedure for obtaining velocities using well logs and plane‐wave reflection seismograms is described. The forward problem is based on the 2-D acoustic wave equation. The inversion is performed by minimizing the difference between the calculated data and the observed data using the least‐squares regularization method. The numerical example shows that the stability and the robustness of the algorithm to noisy data is improved by introducing well logs into the inversion process.,10.1190/1.1444000
Electrical Conductivity Of Brine‐Saturated Fractured Rock,"A theoretical analysis shows that electrical conductivity along fractures in a saturated porous rock is a function of many factors: fluid and rock conductivities, initial fracture aperture and contact area, fracture surface geometry (asperity height distribution and tip curvature), elastic moduli of the rock, and confining pressure or normal stress acting across the fracture. The conductivity in the fracture plane decreases approximately in proportion to log pressure, but the conductivity is influenced by the increased contact area, and hence flow‐path tortuosity, along the fracture surface at elevated pressures. Electrical conductivity in fractures is more affected by flow‐path tortuosity than is permeability. The dependence on pressure was tested using laboratory measurements of conductivity through split cores containing ground, saw‐cut surfaces in a variety of rocks under confining pressures to 200 MPa. The conductivity decreased approximately in proportion to log pressure (there was little effect of increased contact area, and hence tortuosity), which suggests that the contact area may not exceed a few percent of the total apparent area. Measurements of gas permeability through the same split cores showed that when the asperity deformation remained largely elastic, permeability and conductivity had a power of 3 relationship. When asperity collapse occurred, as in a dolomitic marble, the powerlaw relation no longer held; permeability decreased more rapidly under pressure than did conductivity. The different influences of porosity and flow aperture may account for the different behaviors of the two transport properties. The theory suggests a number of ways in which fracture parameters may be extracted from field data. Some of the methods rely on the scale dependence and pressure dependence of the fractured‐rock conductivity; other methods require correlating between different physical properties, such as seismic velocity, which are influenced by the presence of fractures.",10.1190/1.1442209
Interferometry By Deconvolution: Part 1 — Theory For Acoustic Waves And Numerical Examples,"Interferometry allows for synthesis of data recorded at any two receivers into waves that propagate between these receivers as if one of them behaves as a source. This is accomplished typically by crosscorrelations. Based on perturbation theory and representation theorems, we show that interferometry also can be done by deconvolutions for arbitrary media and multidimensional experiments. This is important for interferometry applications in which (1) excitation is a complicated source-time function and/or (2) when wavefield separation methods are used along with interferometry to retrieve specific arrivals. Unlike using crosscorrelations, this method yields only causal scattered waves that propagate between the receivers. We offer a physical interpretation of deconvolution interferometry based on scattering theory. Here we show that deconvolution interferometry in acoustic media imposes an extra boundary condition, which we refer to as the free-point or clamped-point boundary condition, depending on the measured field quantity. This boundary condition generates so-called free-point scattering interactions, which are described in detail. The extra boundary condition and its associated artifacts can be circumvented by separating the reference waves from scattered wavefields prior to interferometry. Three wavefield-separation methods that can be used in interferometry are direct-wave interferometry, dual-field interferometry, and shot-domain separation. Each has different objectives and requirements.",10.1190/1.2904554
Estimating Phase Velocity And Attenuation Of Guided Waves In Acoustic Logging Data,"In acoustic logging, the guided waves which propagate along the borehole are affected by the properties of the formation. For acoustic logging tools with many receivers, array processing methods can be used to calculate the phase velocity and attenuation of these waves. This information is crucial in estimating formation properties like permeability, transverse isotropy, and S-wave velocity.",10.1190/1.1442733
Wave-Equation Reflection Traveltime Inversion With Dynamic Warping And Full-Waveform Inversion,"In reflection seismology, full-waveform inversion (FWI) can generate high-wavenumber subsurface velocity models but often suffers from an objective function with local minima caused mainly by the absence of low frequencies in seismograms. These local minima cause cycle skipping when the low-wavenumber component in the initial velocity model for FWI is far from the true model. To avoid cycle skipping, we discovered a new wave-equation reflection traveltime inversion (WERTI) to update the low-wavenumber component of the velocity model, while using FWI to only update high-wavenumber details of the model. We implemented the low- and high-wavenumber inversions in an alternating way. In WERTI, we used dynamic image warping (DIW) to estimate the time shifts between recorded data and synthetic data. When compared with correlation-based techniques often used in traveltime estimation, DIW can avoid cycle skipping and estimate the time shifts accurately, even when shifts vary rapidly. Hence, by minimizing traveltime shifts estimated by dynamic warping, WERTI reduces errors in reflection traveltime inversion. Then, conventional FWI uses the low-wavenumber component estimated by WERTI as a new initial model and thereby refines the model with high-wavenumber details. The alternating combination of WERTI and FWI mitigates the velocity-depth ambiguity and can recover subsurface velocities using only high-frequency reflection data.",10.1190/geo2013-0004.1
Noise Attenuation By Vibroseis Whitening (Vsw) Processing,"Reflection seismic data recorded on the Atlantic Coastal Plain to examine suspected faulting of the shallow (200 m) basement were contaminated by severe ground roll noise with an apparent velocity of 587 m/sec, 25 Hz dominant frequency, and 23 m apparent wavelength. A receiver interval of 5 m and a total spread length of 285 m were used to obtain 24‐fold coverage. Although the noise problem was severe, overlapping source and/or receiver arrays on the surface were not used for the recording geometry in order to avoid a decrease in resolution caused by the smoothing effect of overlapping subsurface coverage. Instead, the large‐amplitude surface waves were attenuated by a process called Vibroseis® whitening (VSW). VSW is based on the application of time‐varying amplitude scaling before Vibroseis crosscorrelation. A conventional method of automatic digital gain control was found to be effective for this purpose. This scaling results in a signal‐to‐noise ratio improvement equal to the gain expected from crosscorrelation. The scaling window length and the length of sweep are the only parameters required to define the signal‐to‐noise improvement for a given swept‐frequency band. A shorter scaling window and longer sweep length give better results because of the higher gain obtained by crosscorrelation. An increase in the quality of Atlantic Coastal Plain data clearly showed that VSW processing resulted in high resolution on stacked sections and made it possible to map shallow basement reflections at 0.2 sec, revealing faults with up to 10 m offset. Reflections from the sedimentary section above basement also became distinct.",10.1190/1.1441485
A New Approach To Depth Determination From Magnetic Anomalies,"The proposed method was tested both on noisy synthetic and real magnetic data. In the case of synthetic data, the depth curves method determined the correct depths of both coaxial and laterally offset sources. In the case of practical data (vertical component anomaly over a chromite body in the Guleman concession, Turkey), the method suggested the shape of the buried shallow structure resembles a horizontal cylinder model buried at a depth of 31 m and the shape of the buried deep seated structure resembles a dike model buried at a depth of 62 m. The estimated shape and depth of the shallow structure are in very good agreement with the results obtained from drilling and surface geology. The area appears to still hold promise for chromite exploration from the deeper structure.",10.1190/1.1512748
An Optimal Nearly Analytic Discrete-Weighted Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin Hybrid Method For Acoustic Wavefield Modeling,"The newly developed optimal nearly analytic discrete (ONAD) and the weighted Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (WRKDG) methods can effectively suppress the numerical dispersion caused by discretizing wave equations, but it is difficult for ONAD to implement on flexible meshes, whereas the WRKDG has high computational cost for wavefield simulations. We have developed a new hybrid algorithm by combining the ONAD method with the WRKDG method. In this hybrid algorithm, the computational domain was split into several subdomains, in which the subdomain for the ONAD method used regular Cartesian grids, whereas the subdomain for the WRKDG method used triangular grids. The hybrid method was at least third-order spatially accurate. We have applied the proposed method to simulate the scalar wavefields for different models, including a homogeneous model, a rough topography model, a fracture model, and a cave model. The numerical results found that the hybrid method can deal with complicated geometrical structures, effectively suppress numerical dispersion, and provide accurate seismic wavefields. Numerical examples proved that our hybrid method can significantly reduce the CPU time and save storage requirement for the tested models. This implies that the hybrid method is especially suitable for the simulation of waves propagating in complex media.",10.1190/geo2015-0686.1
"Gauss'S Theorem, Mass Deficiency At Chicxulub Crater (Yucatan, Mexico), And The Extinction Of The Dinosaurs","Using Gauss's theorem, we estimated the mass deficiencies of the Chicxulub impact structure (Yucatan, Mexico) from its gravity anomaly. The mass deficiency obtained from the residual gravity anomaly map ranges between 1.06 × 1016 and 1.67 × 1016 kg. Because the gravity anomaly has approximately radial symmetry, we also estimated the mass deficiency from selected profiles. In this way, we obtained slightly lower mass deficiency (6.16 × 1015 to 1.35 × 1016 kg). The central gravity high, which is supposed to be associated with the central structural high, has a mean excess mass of 1.93 × 1014 kg. By assuming a mean density contrast of 100 kg/m3 between the country rock and the sedimentary and brecciated rocks, we estimated the equivalent total mass (1.60 × 1017 to 4.34 × 1017 kg) and volume (6.16 × 1013 to 1.67 × 1014 m3) of breccias and sedimentary rocks responsible for the gravity anomaly. These figures represent lower bounds on the mass and volume ejected from the impact crater. They represent estimates made from geophysical principles and data, and compare well with independent estimates based on other principles such as scaling relations. According to actual estimations of the sulfur dioxide mass generated by the Cretaceous‐Tertiary impact and our results, only a small fraction (about 1%) of the anhydrite in the target strata was vaporized.",10.1190/1.1444455
"1-D Layered Media: Part 2, Layer‐Based Waveform Inversion","We are interested here in the inversion of multioffset data to determine 1-D medium properties. The forward modeling technique accounts for 3-D wave propagation effects. The inversion is performed by minimizing the difference between modeled and reference data using a least‐squares technique. The gradient is computed by the adjoint state technique adapted to the first‐order hyperbolic system and to the Hankel transform. To reduce the number of optimization parameters and to optimize along reflected events from some selected interfaces, we propose a layer‐oriented reparameterization in the full‐waveform inversion. Then we discuss the effect on the inversion results of an incorrect number of layers. The local minima of the least‐squares functional are experimentally investigated and physically interpreted. This sensitivity study has shown that it is necessary to have an accurate initial model for the position of the layer interfaces. In principle, seismic data give access directly to this information. This is why we have formulated the inverse problem in one‐way vertical traveltime as opposed to depth. Using an example, we show that with this parameterization the variation of the least‐ squares misfit function when we change the interval velocity for a given layer tends to a quasi quadratic form. In practice, a layer‐based waveform inversion (LBWI) procedure is proposed to overcome the inherent problem of local minima. The procedure attempts to determine interval velocities, impedance contrasts, and interface positions for a limited number of layers to explain the major seismic events. The LBWI procedure is based on four key elements: traveltime formulation, layer‐based reparameterization, progressive enrichment of the model, and interpretative approach. This procedure is evaluated for a large‐scale acoustic synthetic example.",10.1190/1.1443917
A New Data‐Processing Technique For The Elimination Of Ghost Arrivals On Reflection Seismograms,"A new data‐processing technique is presented for the separation of initially up‐traveling (ghost) energy from initially down‐traveling (primary) energy on reflection seismograms. The method combines records from two or more shot depths after prefiltering each record with a different filter. The filters are designed on a least‐mean‐square‐error criterion to extract primary reflections in the presence of ghost reflections and random noise. Filter design is dependent only on the difference in uphole time between shots, and is independent of the details of near‐surface layering. The method achieves wide‐band separation of primary and ghost energy, which results in 10–15 db greater attenuation of ghost reflections than can be achieved with conventional two‐ or three‐shot stacking (no prefiltering) for ghost elimination. The technique is illustrated in terms of both synthetic and field examples. The deghosted field data are used to study the near‐surface reflection response by computing the optimum linear filter to transform the deghosted trace back into the original ghosted trace. The impulse response of this filter embodies the effects of the near‐surface on the reflection seismogram, i.e. the cause of the ghosting. Analysis of these filters reveals that the ghosting mechanism in the field test area consists of both a surface‐ and base‐of‐weathering layer reflector.",10.1190/1.1439419
Seismic Array Design By Spatial Convolution,"Deriving the response of an array is one thing, designing an array to match a desired response is quite another. The first is easy, the second is not. Given a selected pass and reject requirement in the spatial frequency domain, an array can be obtained that best matches such requirement within the limits of available hardware. Optimum spatial arrays for 2‐D and 3‐D/4‐D seismic surveys can be designed using the technique of spatial convolution. Such a technique relies upon uniform arrays of differing shapes and sizes as building blocks. These building blocks are convolved in space because their selected responses matching notch points against side lobes to achieve a desired end result in the spatial frequency domain. The final array design can be made optimum for a given set of requirements, such as signal preservation within the passband, attenuation within the reject band, and azimuthal distribution for 3‐D/4‐D seismic surveys. For any given design, solely the number and the spacing of the elements limit the optimization. A rule of thumb has been observed which shows that the required number of elements in a 2‐D array for 3‐D/4‐D seismic is equal to the square of the number of elements in a 1‐D equivalent array for 2‐D seismic. It is also observed that for a given number of elements, narrow azimuth designs can offer greater attenuation than wide azimuth designs.",10.1190/1.1487066
Estimation Of Sulfide Content From Induced Polarization Data,"Using electrode spacings ranging from 2 to 10 m, we made 157 measurements of phase and resistivity at 99 sites in four open‐pit porphyry copper mines, thereby sampling a wide variety of rock and alteration types. Rock samples were collected from these sites and examined in the laboratory to characterize the alteration and mineralization and to quantify the sulfide concentration. Our experience has been that in‐situ electrical measurements give a better basis for quantitative correlations between electrical parameters and mineralization than do laboratory measurements on small samples. In general, resistivity declines and phase lag increases as the sulfide content increases, but the scatter in the trends precludes any useful empirical rules. However, the scatter is much reduced when the ratio of phase to resistivity is considered: the ratio increases with the square of the sulfide content. Thus it appears that in many cases the phase‐to‐resistivity ratio can be used to estimate sulfide content. With appropriate conversion factors, this ratio is equivalent to the quadrature component of electrical conductivity and to the metal conduction factor. This dependence of quadrature conductivity upon the square of sulfide content is substantiated by two other data sets taken from the literature. These three independent sets of measurements also seem consistent in showing that the dependence of phase upon sulfide content depends upon mineralization habit. The observed trends must be explained before a satisfactory model of electrical conduction in mineralized rock can be established. These results indicate that careful in‐situ studies have much to offer for further electrical property investigations.",10.1190/1.1441408
Similarity And The Inverse Q Filter: The Pareto‐Levy Stretch,"The seismic impulse response of a constant Q attenuating material has the same mathematical form as the density function for the Pareto‐Levy probability law. Since this law is stable it follows that the seismic pulse is closed under convolution. This means that if the distance from the source x is the sum of two distances x=x1+x2 then the pulse at x is the convolution of the pulse at x1 with the one at x2. Its amplitude is proportional to x1/α where the parameter α{0α1} depends only on Q with α = 1 corresponding to a loss‐free material (Q = ∞). As the pulse loses amplitude it stretches along the time axis so that its area is preserved. This scaling between time and distance is illustrated by the stationary phase approximation for the constant Q pulse. The approximation becomes increasingly more accurate for small values of Q until Q=α=1/2 where it is exact; it becomes the solution to the heat equation. Log‐stretch inverse Q filtering of seismic data is performed by logarithmically stretching the time axis of the data about a reference time so that all broad‐band pulses have the same shape. A time‐stationary inverse filter is then applied in the stretch domain. However the stretching operation is nonlinear and so band‐limited signals will not have the same shape in the stretch domain—the bandwidths of the stretched wavelets will depend upon wavelet position. To avoid energy loss the bandwidth of the inverse filter must be broader than that of the reference wavelet. For events arriving ahead of the reference wavelet the low‐frequency limit must be lowered, while the high‐frequency limit must be increased for later arrivals. Furthermore, Pareto‐Levy scaling suggests tα stretching corrects the residual traveltime errors that accompany the log‐stretch method of inverse Q filtering.",10.1190/1.1443378
Gpr Attenuation And Its Numerical Simulation In 2.5 Dimensions,"Modeling of ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) data in 2.5 dimensions is implemented by superposition of 2-D finite‐difference, time‐domain solutions of Maxwell's equations for different horizontal wavenumbers. Dielectric, magnetic, and conductive losses are included in a single formulation. Attenuations associated with dielectric and magnetic relaxations are introduced by superposition of Debye functions at a set of relaxation frequencies and using memory variables to replace convolutions between the field variables and the decay functions. Better fits to data may always be obtained using the superposition method than by the Cole‐Cole model. Good fits to both loss‐tangent versus frequency data from lab measurements, and to 500 and 900 MHz field GPR profiles of a buried pipe and the surrounding layers, demonstrate the flexibility and viability of the modeling algorithm. Discrepancies between lab and in‐situ measurements may be attributed to scale differences and local variations that make lab samples less representative of the site than the GPR profile.",10.1190/1.1444151
Note On Well‐Shooting Data And Linear Increase Of Velocity,"The problem of converting well‐shooting data into parameters necessary for interpretation is an important one. When the data seem to lend themselves to the hypothesis of a linear increase of velocity with depth, i.e., v=v0+ah, the problem is one of determining the constants v0 and a from the data.",10.1190/1.1437629
Seismic Inversion For The Parameters Of Two Orthogonal Fracture Sets In A Vti Background Medium,"If the VTI symmetry of the background is caused by intrinsic anisotropy (as is usually the case for shales), it may be possible to determine at least one background anisotropic coefficient from borehole or core measurements. Then seismic data can be inverted for the fracture weaknesses and the rest of the background parameters. Therefore, seismic characterization of reservoirs with multiple fracture sets and anisotropic background is expected to give ambiguous results, unless the input data include measurements made on different scales (surface seismic, borehole, cores).",10.1190/1.1451801
Discussions On Induced Polarization: Authors' Second Reply,"We have received a copy of W.'s second discussion on the induced polarization problem. After reading it thoroughly, our position is unchanged. The aquifer is not a ""linear medium"" because the motions of the ions are essentially different with and without electric field. Therefore, values for the dielectric constant calculated on the decay part of the curves do not have to agree with the ones calculated from the magnitude of the induced polarization signal.",10.1190/1.1486528
Cross‐Borehole Simulation Of Wave Propagation,"Synthetic seismograms are used to study elastic wave propagation in multi‐layered media for cross‐borehole geometries. The calculations are done using the discrete wavenumber method. We compute the wavefield for a series of receiver arrays located at various offsets to follow the evolution of the wavefronts and the distribution of the seismic energy in space. The results show the complexity of the wavefield at large offsets. Trapped waves and conical waves perturb the identification of direct and primary reflected phases. The display of polarization diagrams of the guided waves shows elliptical prograde motions. The source position plays an important role in the energy distribution within the medium. In order to study this dependency, we compare the cases of sources located in relatively low and high‐velocity layers. In the former case, most of the energy is trapped within the source layer and in the neighboring region and propagates horizontally. The S‐converted waves generated at the interfaces bounding the source layer have larger amplitude than the direct P‐wave. When the source is placed in a relatively high‐velocity layer the energy of the P‐wavefront spreads rapidly throughout the medium as the offset increases.",10.1190/1.1443122
Interval Velocity Analysis Using Multiparameter Common Image Gathers,"We developed a nonconventional approach to interval velocity analysis. The motivation for this approach is based on the argument that when the subsurface structure is complex, velocity error cannot be related to a single parameter. The suggested analysis uses multiparameter common image gathers (MPCIGs), generated by standard prestack depth migration. The parameterization of these multiparameter gathers is directly related to the structural characteristics of the subsurface image points. The undesirable summation, which is usually involved in the generation of conventional common image gathers, is avoided. During the velocity analysis procedure, depth slices taken out of the calculated MPCIGs are examined. Each depth slice contains all seismic data that were migrated into a single image point associated with the specific depth slice. When the MPCIGs are generated with the correct velocity function, each depth slice holds all structural information associated with the corresponding image point. Through detailed analysis of 2D synthetic and real data examples, the influence of migration velocity errors on the accuracy of the migrated multiparameter gathers is demonstrated. A Kirchhoff-based algorithm is used for the migration along with a layer-stripping method, relying on velocity scans, for the analysis. A velocity correctness criterion was also verified, along with some suggestions on the practical usage of the method.",10.1190/geo2011-0403.1
Automatic Boundary Extraction From Magnetic Field Data Using Triangular Meshes,"Boundary extraction is a collective term that we use for the process of extracting the locations of faults, lineaments, and lateral boundaries between geologic units using geophysical observations, such as measurements of the magnetic field. The process typically begins with a preprocessing stage, where the data are transformed to enhance the visual clarity of pertinent features and hence improve the interpretability of the data. The majority of the existing methods are based on raster grid enhancement techniques, and the boundaries are extracted as a series of points or line segments. In contrast, we set out a methodology for boundary extraction from magnetic data, in which we represent the transformed data as a surface in 3D using a mesh of triangular facets. After initializing the mesh, we modify the node locations, such that the mesh smoothly represents the transformed data and that facet edges are aligned with features in the data that approximate the horizontal locations of subsurface boundaries. To illustrate our boundary extraction algorithm, we first apply it to a synthetic data set. We then apply it to identify boundaries in a magnetic data set from the McFaulds Lake area in Ontario, Canada. The extracted boundaries are in agreement with known boundaries and several of the regions that are completely enclosed by extracted boundaries coincide with regions of known mineralization.",10.1190/geo2015-0112.1
Reducing Spurious Diffractions In Elastic Wavefield Calculations,"A persistent problem in using discrete solution methods for wave propagation calculations arises from the discretization process itself. Since the cell size is finite, a gridded version of a complicated model is necessarily somewhat inaccurate. For instance, when a velocity or density interface in a model is not aligned with the grid, it is usually represented in a ""staircase fashion."" The steps in the model then cause spurious diffractions in the calculated wavefield no matter what numerical method is used. In fact, the problem becomes more severe with modern numerical methods such as the Fourier pseudospectral and staggered‐grid, finite‐difference methods, as they allow relatively coarse gridding of the model. To reduce these nonphysical diffractions, techniques based on either a grid of varying spacing (Jastram and Tessmer, 1994) or a curved grid through a mapping (Fornberg, 1988; Nielsen et al., 1994) have been proposed. Muir et al. (1992) introduced some anisotropy into the model using the Schoenberg‐Muir calculus and obtained good results.",10.1190/1.1444069
Anisotropy Of Elastic Wave Velocities In Deformed Shales: Part 2 — Modeling Results,"This study was devoted to the interpretation of the evolution of elastic wave velocities in anisotropic shales that are subjected to deformation experiments in the laboratory. A micromechanical model was used to describe the macroscopic effective elastic properties and anisotropy of the rock in terms of its microscopic features, such as intrinsic anisotropy and crack/pore geometry. The experimental data (reported in Part 1) were compared quantitatively with the micromechanical model predictions to gain some insight into the microstructural behavior of the rock during deformation. The inversion of the experimental data using the micromechanical model was carried out by means of a numerical minimization of the least-squares distance between data and model in terms of effective compliances. Under isotropic mechanical loading, the overall behavior of the dry shale is consistent with the closure of crack-like pores, which are aligned in theplane of symmetry of the transversely isotropic background matrix. Those cracks represent a low fraction of the total porosity, but they have a strong effect on elastic wave velocities. The data are consistent with an initial (horizontal) crack density of 0.07. Crack closure also is evidenced at early stages of axial loading applied perpendicular to the shale bedding plane, whereas crack density increases significantly as axial stress is increased. Interpretation of the wet experiment is less straightforward, although some preliminary conclusions could be drawn. Under isotropic stress, crack closure also is evidenced, whereas crack density remains constant at the early stages of deviatoric loading. When axial peak stress is approached, crack density increases drastically, which likely indicates onset and development of vertical cracking. Wet experiments probably are more complex because water is likely to be expelled from crack-like pores toward equant pores in response to the mechanical loading.",10.1190/1.2952745
Numerical Analysis Of Relative Resistivity For A Horizontally Layered Earth,"The method of calculating the relative resistivity, which is the ratio of the apparent resistivity to the resistivity of the upper layer, for a multiple‐layered earth is given by means of the expansion of the kernel function according to a complete system of normalized orthogonal polynomials. The method, which includes estimation of the accuracy to be expected, is illustrated by application to a three‐layer earth.",10.1190/1.1439168
Extended Elastic Impedance For Fluid And Lithology Prediction,"In this paper we demonstrate that EEI can be tuned using different χ values to be approximately proportional to a number of elastic parameters, and we give EEI expressions for shear impedance (SI), bulk modulus, shear modulus, Lamé's parameter, and Vp/Vs. This leads to the identification of different areas of EEI space that tend to be optimum for fluid and lithology imaging. Having identified an appropriate χ value, the equivalent seismic section can be obtained from combinations of intercept and gradient stacks from routine AVO processing.",10.1190/1.1451337
Using An Equivalent Source With Positivity For Low-Latitude Reduction To The Pole Without Striation,"We present a reformulation of reduction to the pole (RTP) of magnetic data at low latitudes and the equator using equivalent sources. The proposed method addresses both the theoretical difficulty of low-latitude instability and the practical issue of computational cost. We prove that a positive equivalent source exists when the magnetic data are produced by normal induced magnetization, and we show that the positivity is sufficient to overcome the low-latitude instability in the space domain. We further apply a regularization term directly to the recovered RTP field to improve the solution. The use of equivalent source also naturally enables the processing of data acquired on uneven surface. The result is a practical algorithm that is effective at the equatorial region and can process large-scale data sets with uneven observation heights.",10.1190/geo2014-0134.1
The Electromagnetic Response In A Layered Vertical Transverse Isotropic Medium: A New Look At An Old Problem,"We determined that the electromagnetic vertical transverse isotropic response in a layered earth can be obtained by solving two equivalent scalar equations, which were for the vertical electric field and for the vertical magnetic field, involving only a scalar global reflection coefficient. Besides the complete derivation of the full electromagnetic response, we also developed the corresponding computer code called EMmod, which models the full electromagnetic fields including internal multiples in the frequency-wavenumber domain and obtains the frequency-space domain solutions through a Hankel transformation by computing the Hankel integral using a 61-point Gauss-Kronrod integration routine. The code is able to model the 3D electromagnetic field in a 1D earth for diffusive methods such as controlled source electromagnetics as well as for wave methods such as ground penetrating radar. The user has complete freedom to place the source and the receivers in any layer. The modeling is illustrated with three examples, which aim to present the different capabilities of EMmod, while assessing its correctness.",10.1190/geo2013-0411.1
"Application Of Microgravimetric Survey In Samawa Salt Deposit, Iraq",The applicability of microgravimetric surveys for determining the thickness and shape of a salt deposit has been explored by carrying out field measurements. The survey includes five profiles crossing a Samawa salt deposit that attains a maximum thickness of about 8.5 m. The results indicate that the method can be applied successfully if a few boreholes are available as control points to define the local regional field. A simple sheet formula with a fixed density value was used in determining the bed thickness and the general shape of the deposit. The thicknesses calculated in this way agree well with the available borehole information.,10.1190/1.1442669
Complex Seismic Trace Analysis Of Thin Beds,"Displays of complex trace attributes can help to define thin beds in seismic sections. If the wavelet in a section is zero phase, low impedance strata whose thicknesses are of the order of half the peak‐to‐peak period of the dominant seismic energy show up as anomalously high‐amplitude zones on instantaneous amplitude sections. These anomalies result from the well‐known amplitude tuning effect which occurs when reflection coefficients of opposite polarity a half period apart are convolved with a seismic wavelet. As the layers thin to a quarter period of the dominant seismic energy, thinning is revealed by an anomalous increase in instantaneous frequency. This behavior results from the less well‐known but equally important phenomenon of frequency tuning by beds which thin laterally. Instantaneous frequency reaches an anomalously high value when bed thickness is about a quarter period and remains high as the bed continues to thin. In this paper, complex trace analysis is applied to a synthetic model of a wedge and to a set of broadband field data acquired to delineate thin lenses of porous sandstone. The two case studies illustrate that sets of attribute displays can be used to verify the presence and dimensions of thin beds when definition of the beds is not obvious on conventional seismic sections.",10.1190/1.1441670
Splitting Algorithms For The High-Order Compact Finite-Difference Schemes In Wave-Equation Modeling,"We have developed efficient splitting algorithms for high-order compact finite-difference methods to approximate second-order space derivatives. In general, the methods' high-order compact finite-difference schemes require the inversion of a multidiagonal matrix that is commonly less efficient. To solve this problem, we used ideas from splitting algorithms in one-way wave-equation migration that work by decomposing the multidiagonal matrix into a series of tridiagonal matrices and then subsequently solving the tridiagonal matrices. This approach results in more efficient algorithms with little loss of accuracy. The splitting algorithms can be implemented in three different ways. Our computational complexity analysis verifies that our methods can reduce the calculation burden from exponential to linear growth. Numerical experiments demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of our algorithms.",10.1190/geo2015-0418.1
"Compressional Velocities Of Partially Saturated, Unconsolidated Sands","The possibilities inherent in reflection amplitude anomalies or ""bright spots"" on seismic cross‐sections as indications of gaseous hydrocarbons have stimulated widespread interest. To help evaluate these possibilities, laboratory measurements were made on specimens of compacted Ottawa sand of approximately 30 percent porosity. The measurements were made at five different water saturations (0 percent and 100 percent, and approximately 9 percent, 45 percent, and 85 percent) and net confining pressures to 10,000 psi. The gas was air. Measurements were made with acoustic pulses with a peak frequency of about 700 khz.",10.1190/1.1440589
Cation Exchange And Induced Electrical Polarization,"A report has been made by Vacquier et al. (1957) on the detection of ground water by induced electrical polarization (I.P.). Direct current is introduced into the ground at two points for a short period of time. The current is then interrupted and a small induced voltage, which may take several minutes to decay, appears between another pair of electrodes. Vacquier suggested that the I.P. might be pictured as being due to local electrodialysis of the clay across semi‐permeable membranes formed by adjacent sand grains. When the current is shut off, the induced potential dies away as the exchangeable ions slowly redistribute themselves along the clay.",10.1190/1.1438556
The Effect Of Lateral Inhomogeneity On Velocity Determination,"In recent papers, Taner et al. (1970) and Schneider (1971) pointed out that when the subsurface varies laterally at a rate such that all rays collected for velocity analysis do not penetrate the same earth column, the velocity found from the analysis will be erroneous. The conclusions of Taner were based on ray‐tracing computations; Schneider did not state the basis for his illustrations. If we are willing to assume the Dix (1955) approximation, i.e., that a time‐distance curve for a reflection from a plane is the hyperbola ",10.1190/1.1440374
Robust Processing Of Noisy Land-Based Controlled-Source Electromagnetic Data,"Whereas robust processing techniques are routinely used for estimating high-quality magnetotelluric (MT) transfer functions, such techniques are not commonly applied for controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) processing, although CSEM and MT data suffer from similar noise. We implemented a new CSEM processing scheme that combines CSEM-specific preprocessing with statistically robust least-squares stacking to extract interpretable ground responses from very noisy onshore CSEM data. We applied the robust processing to signals from a new CSEM transmitter that was equipped with three grounded electrodes and allowed us to generate signals at multiple source polarizations with relatively little field effort. For this transmitter setup, we formulated a bivariate relation between the source currents injected through any two of the three source electrodes and the recorded electromagnetic field components. The resulting weighted least-squares system of equations from which we determined ground responses allowed us to jointly process data from multiple polarizations. Using several polarizations resulted in more stable response estimates than can be obtained from standard configurations with two distinct source dipole orientations. Exploiting dependencies between the three basic response functions that we obtain allows consistency checking and demonstrates the stability of our robust processing scheme. From the basic responses, data at arbitrary source polarizations can be synthesized, which may be useful for optimizing target illumination. We tested the benefits of robust CSEM processing using examples of data recorded across the CO2 storage test site at Ketzin, Germany, in an area heavily affected by various sources of strong cultural noise, including impressed-current cathodic protection systems, wind power plants, and major power lines.",10.1190/geo2013-0026.1
The Form And Laws Of Propagation Of Seismic Wavelets,"An attack has been made upon the problem of the form of the seismic disturbance which proceeds outward from the explosion of a charge of dynamite and the laws of propagation of this disturbance. A mathematical theory was developed about ten years ago and a small amount of experimental work carried out at that time encouraged further efforts. Recently an extensive series of experimental researches have been carried out in a sensibly homogeneous shale section, and as a result of these studies a rather clear understanding of the form and nature of the primary seismic disturbance, and its laws of propagation, has been obtained for shale. The results are in good agreement with the theory.",10.1190/1.1437843
Textural Control On The Quadrature Conductivity Of Porous Media,"Induced polarization (IP) has been broadly used for environmental and hydrogeological applications and in civil engineering. The IP response of a porous medium without metallic particles (described by its quadrature conductivity or its normalized chargeability) is controlled by the interfacial electrochemistry of the electrical double layer and the pore-space geometry. We use the specific surface per unit pore volume normalized by the formation factor (i.e., Spor/F) as the controlling textural parameter for the quadrature conductivity. This relationship is obtained by averaging the surface conductance over the pore volume. A database that contains 76 samples (including porous borosilicate glass, sandstones, and clayey sediments) is used to check the new scaling. In addition to these data, we have conducted new IP measurements on 13 samples from the Middle Bakken Formation corresponding to low-porosity clayey materials. Comparison between the experimental data and our model confirms that the ratio Spor/F is the dominant textural parameter describing the quadrature conductivity σ′′ of a broad range of porous media. The database was also used to test whether the quadrature conductivity depended either on Spor, or the specific surface area Sm, or the ratio Sm/(Fφ) (φ being the connected porosity). Although the quadrature conductivity scales with Spor and Sm for high-porosity sandstones, these relationships are not appropriate for the low-porosity clayey materials presented in this study. However, experimental data support the dependence of the quadrature conductivity on Sm/(Fφ), a published relationship obtained through the volume averaging approach.",10.1190/geo2015-0715.1
Poststack Velocity Analysis By Separation And Imaging Of Seismic Diffractions,"Small geologic features manifest themselves in seismic data in the form of diffracted waves, which are fundamentally different from seismic reflections. Using two field-data examples and one synthetic example, we demonstrate the possibility of separating seismic diffractions in the data and imaging them with optimally chosen migration velocities. Our criteria for separating reflection and diffraction events are the smoothness and continuity of local event slopes that correspond to reflection events. For optimal focusing, we develop the local varimax measure. The objectives of this work are velocity analysis implemented in the poststack domain and high-resolution imaging of small-scale heterogeneities. Our examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for high-resolution imaging of such geologic features as faults, channels, and salt boundaries.",10.1190/1.2781533
Algorithms For Least‐Squares Linear Prediction And Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis—Part Ii: Fortran Program,"We present a set of Fortran subroutines which implement the least‐squares algorithm described in Part I (Barrodale and Erickson, 1980, this issue) for solving three variants of the linear prediction problem. When combined with a suitable driver program, these subroutines can be used to calculate maximum entropy spectra without imposing a Toeplitz structure on the model.",10.1190/1.1441092
Finite‐Element Analysis Of Controlled‐Source Electromagnetic Induction Using Coulomb‐Gauged Potentials,"A 3-D finite‐element solution has been used to solve controlled‐source electromagnetic (EM) induction problems in heterogeneous electrically conducting media. The solution is based on a weak formulation of the governing Maxwell equations using Coulomb‐gauged EM potentials. The resulting sparse system of linear algebraic equations is solved efficiently using the quasi‐minimal residual method with simple Jacobi scaling as a preconditioner. The main aspects of this work include the implementation of a 3-D cylindrical mesh generator with high‐quality local mesh refinement and a formulation in terms of secondary EM potentials that eliminates singularities introduced by the source. These new aspects provide quantitative induction‐log interpretation for petroleum exploration applications. Examples are given for 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D problems, and favorable comparisons are presented against other, previously published multidimensional EM induction codes. The method is general and can also be adapted for controlled‐source EM modeling in mining, groundwater, and environmental geophysics in addition to fundamental studies of EM induction in heterogeneous media.",10.1190/1.1444968
Exponential Asymptotically Bounded Velocity Model: Part I — Effective Models And Velocity Transformations,"A new compacted-sediment, vertical-velocity model that represents the effect of gradually increasing velocities with depth is proposed. An asymptotically bounded, exponential velocity model is defined by three intuitive parameters. For a given layer, the parameters are 1) the velocity, 2) its vertical gradient at the top interface, and 3) an upper-limit velocity value. Time-depth relations, velocity transformations, hyperbolic, and nonhyperbolic moveouts are derived. The entire vertical velocity profile is composed of a set of layers, where the velocity function for each layer is defined by the proposed model. This method provides a basis for describing the subsurface using a smaller number of thick layers rather than using the classical, linear velocity model.",10.1190/1.2196033
Poststack Estimation Of Three‐Dimensional Crossline Statics,"In three‐dimensional land data acquisition, the crossline dimension of the receiver spread is often much smaller than the inline dimension, typically for reasons of economy. Because of fundamental wavenumber limitations in the estimation of residual statics by prestack surface consistent methods, unresolved static errors will persist through processing to the stack data, particularly in the crossline direction. The present method involves an analysis of poststack 3-D data through the creation of a correlation time surface from crosscorrelations of adjacent stack data traces. This time surface is decomposed in the wavenumber domain to isolate and correct some of the spectral components of residual static errors which are beyond the resolution of prestack approaches. Assumptions are implicit within the method regarding the expected 2-D wavenumber nature of the wave field response of true geologic structure. The method is proposed as an additional procedure to the standard 3-D processing sequence for land data.",10.1190/1.1441655
Seismic Reflector Imaging Using Internal Multiples With Marchenko-Type Equations,"We present an imaging method that creates a map of reflection coefficients in correct one-way time with no contamination from internal multiples using purely a filtering approach. The filter is computed from the measured reflection response and does not require a background model. We demonstrate that the filter is a focusing wavefield that focuses inside a layered medium and removes all internal multiples between the surface and the focus depth. The reflection response and the focusing wavefield can then be used for retrieving virtual vertical seismic profile data, thereby redatuming the source to the focus depth. Deconvolving the upgoing by the downgoing vertical seismic profile data redatums the receiver to the focus depth and gives the desired image. We then show that, for oblique angles of incidence in horizontally layered media, the image of the same quality as for 1D waves can be constructed. This step can be followed by a linear operation to determine velocity and density as a function of depth. Numerical simulations show the method can handle finite frequency bandwidth data and the effect of tunneling through thin layers.",10.1190/geo2013-0095.1
Inversion Of Potential‐Field Data By Iterative Forward Modeling In The Wavenumber Domain,"Direct inversion of potential‐field data is hindered by the nonuniqueness of the general solution. Convergence to a single solution can only be obtained when external constraints are placed on the subsurface geometry. Two such constrained geometries are dealt with here: a single, nonplanar interface between two layers, each of uniform density or magnetization, and the distribution of the density or magnetization contrast within a single layer. Both of these simple geometries have geologic application. Inversion is accomplished by iterative improvement in an initial subsurface model in the wavenumber domain. The inversion process is stable and is efficient for usage on large data sets. Forward calculation of anomalies is by Parker's (1973) algorithm (Blakely, 1981).",10.1190/1.1443175
Understanding Lotem Data From Mountainous Terrain,"Long‐offset transient electromagnetic (LOTEM) data from the Vesuvius volcano, in Italy, show that the EM response of the topography is a potential cause of data distortions. A modeling study was carried out to simulate the effect of mountainous terrain on vertical magnetic‐field time derivatives using a 3-D finite‐difference code. The objectives were to assess the importance of topographic effects and to help identify them in existing field data. The total effect of topography on the LOTEM response can be considered as a combination of four distortions of the corresponding responses for a flat terrain. First, the receiver is at some height above the flat surface. Second, the mountain acts as a conductive body displacing air. Third, large loop receivers are nonhorizontal and sense a combination of horizontal and vertical magnetic fields. Finally, the electromagnetic coupling between the mountain and deeper‐lying structure modifies the structure response. Each of the effects can be identified in field data recorded at Mount Vesuvius. The topographic induced distortions for the model used in this study are moderate in the sense that 1-D inversions of the theoretical data still recover the gross conductivity structure, albeit with small deviations from the true parameters. Although this result might imply that topography might be ignored during the first stage of an interpretation, no simple correction method is evident, so topography will have to be included in any 2-D or 3-D inversion attempt.",10.1190/1.1444804
Gradient Measurements In Ground Magnetic Prospecting,"The development of electronic magnetometers, i.e., the proton‐precession and fluxgate instruments, for use in ground magnetic surveys has permitted the measurement of the first‐vertical derivative of the total field, or of the vertical component of that field, with negligible addition to the total cost of the survey. The gain in information is, however, significant. Curves for the vertical gradient over a vertical contact, point pole, and finite dipole are presented. The vertical contact is outlined by the zero contour for the vertical gradient of the vertical component, and the depth of burial is half the horizontal distance between the positive and negative maxima. The depth of burial of the point pole and finite dipole is approximately equal to the horizontal distance between the negative half‐maximum points on the vertical‐gradient curves.",10.1190/1.1439592
Highly Aliased Ground-Roll Suppression Using A 3D Multiwindow Karhunen-Loève Filter: Application To A Legacy Mississippi Lime Survey,"Although modern recording capacity facilitates dense seismic acquisition, many, if not most, legacy 3D land surveys are spatially aliased with respect to ground roll. Irregular topography and weathering zones give rise to ground roll that has piecewise rather than continuous linear moveout (LMO). Dispersion often results in shingled events whose phase velocity cuts across the ground-roll noise cone. We have developed a workflow for the suppression of highly aliased broadband ground roll in which modern f-kx-ky filters failed. Our workflow began with low-pass filtering and windowing the data, 3D patch by 3D patch. We then applied LMO corrections using an average phase velocity of the ground roll and improved these moveout corrections through the use of local three-shot by three-receiver 3D velocity scans about each sample to account for lateral changes in velocity, thickness, and weathering zone topography. Using a Kuwahara algorithm, we chose the most coherent window within which we applied a structure-oriented Karhunen-Loève filter to model the coherent noise. Finally, we removed the LMO correction and subtracted the modeled ground roll from the original data. We applied our workflow to a legacy data volume consisting of four merged 3D surveys acquired in the 1990s. Application of modern seismic attributes showed improved mapping of faults and flexures. We also validated our workflow using a synthetic gather having the same geometry as our field data.",10.1190/geo2014-0442.1
Analysis Of Fluid Substitution In A Porous And Fractured Medium,"To improve quantitative interpretation of seismic data, we analyze the effect of fluid substitution in a porous and fractured medium on elastic properties and reflection coefficients. This analysis uses closed-form expressions suitable for fluid substitution in transversely isotropic media with a horizontal symmetry axis (HTI). For the HTI medium, the effect of changing porosity and water saturation on (1) P-wave moduli, (2) horizontal and vertical velocities, (3) anisotropic parameters, and (4) reflection coefficients are examined. The effects of fracture density on these four parameters are also studied. For the model used in this study, a 35% increase in porosity lowers the value of P-wave moduli by maximum of 45%. Consistent with the reduction in P-wave moduli, P-wave velocities also decrease by maximum of 17% with a similar increment in porosity. The reduction is always larger for the horizontal P-wave modulus than for the vertical one and is nearly independent of fracture density. The magnitude of the anisotropic parameters of the fractured medium also changes with increased porosity depending on the changes in the value of P-wave moduli. The reflection coefficients at an interface of the fractured medium with an isotropic medium change in accordance with the above observations and lead to an increase in anisotropic amplitude variation with offset (AVO) gradient with porosity. Additionally, we observe a maximum increase in P-wave modulus and velocity by 30% and 8%, respectively, with a 100% increase in water saturation. Water saturation also changes the anisotropic parameters and reflection coefficients. Increase in water saturation considerably increases the magnitude of the anisotropic AVO gradient irrespective of fracture density. From this study, we conclude that porosity and water saturation have a significant impact on the four studied parameters and the impacts are seismically detectable.",10.1190/1.3564954
Traveltime And Wavefront Curvature Calculations In Three‐Dimensional Inhomogeneous Layered Media With Curved Interfaces,"The seismic rays and wavefront curvatures are determined by solving a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. For media with constant velocity and for media with constant velocity gradient, simplified solutions exist. In a general inhomogeneous medium these equations must be solved by numerical approximations. The integration of the ray‐tracing and wavefront curvature equations is then performed by a modified divided difference form of the Adams PECE (Predict‐Evaluate‐Correct‐Evaluate) formulas and local extrapolation. The interfaces between the layers are represented by bicubic splines. The changes in ray direction and wavefront curvature at the interfaces are computed using standard formulas. For three‐dimensional media, two quadratic traveltime approximations have been proposed. Both are based on a Taylor series expansion with reference to a ray from a reference source point to a reference receiver point. The first approximation corresponds to expanding the square of the traveltime in a Taylor series and taking the square root of the result. The second approximation corresponds to expanding the traveltime in a Taylor series. The two traveltime approximations may be expressed in source‐receiver coordinates or in midpoint‐half‐offset coordinates. Simplified expressions are obtained when the reference source and receiver coincide, giving zero‐offset approximations, for which the reference ray is a normal‐incidence ray. A new method is proposed for computing the second derivatives of the normal‐incidence traveltime with respect to the source‐receiver midpoint coordinates. By considering a beam of normal‐incidence rays it is shown that the second‐derivative matrix may be found by computing the wavefront curvature along a reference normal‐incidence ray starting at the reflection point with the wavefront curvature equal to the curvature of the reflecting interface. From this second‐derivative matrix the normal moveout velocity can be computed for any seismic line through the reference source‐receiver midpoint. It is also shown how a reverse wavefront curvature calculation may be used, in a time‐to‐depth migration scheme, to compute the curvature of the reflecting interface from the estimated second derivatives of the normal‐incidence traveltime. Numerical results for different three‐dimensional models indicate that the first traveltime approximation, based on an expansion of the square of the traveltime, is the most accurate for shallow reflectors and for simple models. For deeper reflectors the two approximations give comparable results, and for models with complicated velocity variations the second approximation may be slightly better than the first one, depending on the particular model chosen. A simplified traveltime approximation may be used in a three‐dimensional seismic velocity analysis. Instead of estimating the stacking velocity one must estimate three elements in a 2×2 symmetric matrix. The accuracy and range of validity of the simplified traveltime approximation are investigated for different three‐dimensional models.",10.1190/1.1441774

The Influence Of Currents Induced In The Host Rock On Electromagnetic Response Of A Spheroid Directly Beneath A Loop,"A variety of time‐domain and frequency‐domain electromagnetic (EM) methods has come into use in minerals exploration for detection of conductive ore bodies. Because the responses of these various systems differ markedly from one another, the question arises as to which is the most effective for use in discovering a buried, conductive ore body. The question can be posed as follows: What type of exploration system provides the best signal‐to‐noise (S/N) ratio, when signal is defined as the anomalous EM field caused by the presence of a target body and noise is defined as EM responses from the surrounding medium? Analytic solution of the problem is tedious and has not yet been reported in the literature. I describe some results for a special case which reduces the complexity of the problem somewhat. The case treated is that of a conducting spheroid situated directly beneath a source loop. The EM responses caused by currents in the spheroid and in the surrounding medium were computed in both the frequency domain and time domain, using the integral equation approach, supplemented with evaluations of asymptotic expression for various field components. Results show that the transient method provides the best S/N ratio of the methods considered.",10.1190/1.1441253
Reciprocity Properties Of One‐Way Propagators,"Acoustic reciprocity is a fundamental property of the wave equation for the total acoustic wavefield (Rayleigh, 1878). In its most elementary form the reciprocity principle states that an acoustic response remains the same when the source and receiver are interchanged. In terms of Green's functions this reciprocity principle reads G(r2, r1) = G(r1, r2), with r = (x, y, z). For more general expressions and their seismic applications, see Fokkema and van den Berg (1993).",10.1190/1.1444473
Synthetic Seismograms For A Long Spread Of Seismometer Stations,"The assumption that the earth is made up of planeparallel, homogeneous, elastic layers, which can exhibit transverse isotropy and moderate constant‐Q attenuation, leads to an effective method of modeling the response from a point source into a long spread of seismometer stations. Most of the computations are carried out in the complex frequency and complex horizontal wavenumber domains. Minimum sampling criteria are based on an algorithm that suppresses time and distance aliasing at the expense of the large dynamic range available on the digital computer. Other artifacts can be identified and are removed by additional wavenumber filtering. Computational effort is almost independent of the number of detectors and their nature. The structure and symmetry properties of the propagator matrices describing the response are the same for isotropic and transversely isotropic layers. Synthetic seismic panels for a regional model of a west Texas well site exhibit strong, shot‐generated surface waves. A very simple model, based on a south Texas well site, shows the effects of transverse isotropy and the reverberatory nature of converted signals generated by a surface P‐wave.",10.1190/1.1443607
Spectral Induced Polarization Parameters As Determined Through Time‐Domain Measurements,A method for the extraction of Cole-Cole spectral parameters from time‐domain induced polarization data is demonstrated. The instrumentation required to effect the measurement and analysis is described. The Cole-Cole impedance model is shown to work equally well in the time domain as in the frequency domain. Field trials show the time‐domain method to generate spectral parameters consistent with those generated by frequency‐domain surveys. This is shown to be possible without significant alteration to field procedures. Cole-Cole time constants of up to 100 s are shown to be resolvable given a transmitted current of a 2 s pulse‐time. The process proves to have added usefulness as the Cole-Cole forward solution proves an excellent basis for quantifying noise in the measured decay.,10.1190/1.1441610
Experimental Design: Electrical Resistivity Data Sets That Provide Optimum Subsurface Information,"Although multielectrode electrical‐resistivity systems have been commercially available for more than a decade, resistivity imaging of the subsurface continues to be based on data sets recorded using one or more of the standard electrode arrays (e.g., the Wenner or conventional dipole‐dipole array). To exploit better the full capabilities of multielectrode acquisition systems, we have developed an experimental design procedure to identify suites of electrode configurations that provide subsurface information according to predefined optimization criteria. The experimental design algorithm includes a goodness function that ranks the sensitivity of every possible electrode configuration to changes in the subsurface parameters. To examine the potential and limitations of the new algorithm, comprehensive data sets that included data from all standard and nonstandard electrode configurations were (a) generated for a complex 2D resistivity model and (b) recorded across a well‐studied test site in Switzerland. Images determined from the resultant comprehensive data sets were used as benchmarks against which the images derived from the optimized data sets were assessed. Images from relatively small optimized data sets, containing 265–282 data points, provided more information than did those from standard data sets of equal size. By far the best images, comparable to those determined from the much larger comprehensive data sets, were obtained from optimized data sets with 1000–6000 data points. These images supplied reliable information over depth ranges that were three times greater than the depth ranges resolved by the standard images. The first ∼600 electrode configurations selected by the experimental design procedure were nonstandard dipole‐dipole‐type arrays, whereas the following ∼4800 electrode configurations were an approximately equal mix of nonstandard dipole‐dipole‐type arrays and nested configurations (i.e., mostly gradient and other nonstandard arrays).",10.1190/1.1649381
The Radiation Characteristics Of An Arbitrary Antenna Positioned On A Polar Ice Sheet,"The radiation pattern of an arbitrarily shaped antenna system placed directly on the surface of a polar ice sheet (a configuration often used for ice‐probing radars) may be determined at any depth within the ice sheet using a two‐step process. The distribution of the radiated field just beneath the surface may be determined first using the method of moments, and geometric optics can then be used to calculate the effects of the exponential density gradient of the ice. Closed‐form solutions of the ray‐tracing equation, valid at any depth within the ice sheet, allow rapid calculation of the effective look angles and gain increases of any antenna mounted on the surface. These solutions asymptotically approach previously determined relations which are valid only at great depths. A numerical example demonstrates the use of this procedure in the design of a practical ice‐probing radar antenna system.",10.1190/1.1442285
Leveling Airborne Gamma‐Radiation Data Using Between‐Channel Correlation Information,"A procedure for estimating background‐correction terms for the uranium channel of an airborne gamma‐ray survey has been developed. The residuals obtained from a multiple linear regression of flight‐line means for the uranium channel on the means for thorium and potassium are used to correct the uranium channel for each line. The procedure assumes that, were it not for these background errors, the uranium flight‐line means would be a linear function of the means for potassium and thorium. It also assumes that the background correction is the same for the whole of each line. In spite of these limitations, the method produces good background estimates consistent with those found by more sophisticated methods.",10.1190/1.1442272
Preliminary Study Of The Crustal Structure Across The Campeche Escarpment From Gravity Data,"A possible structure of the earth's crust across Campeche Escarpment, Gulf of Mexico, was resolved by utilizing the gravity measurements made on the AM College of Texas Research Vessel HIDALGO and by combining these data with published seismic information. The La Coste‐Romberg surface‐ship gravity meter S‐9 of AM College, owned by the Office of Naval Research, was the gravity instrument used. The method used herein effectively reduces an infinite number of possible structures to a few possible structures. A total of 915 km of continuous gravity profile was traversed from June 29 to July 1, 1961. Accuracy of the gravity profiles appears to be satisfactory for this kind of crustal investigation. This report is intended as a basis for further studies; no attempts were made to ascertain the geologic events in detail. From this investigation it appears that the escarpment is nontectonic in origin, although the possibility of a crustal fault below the escarpment cannot be ignored.",10.1190/1.1439264
Finite-Difference Modeling Of Wave Propagation On Microscale: A Snapshot Of The Work In Progress,"Digital rock methodology combines modern microscopic imaging with advanced numerical simulations of the physical properties of rocks. Modeling of elastic-wave propagation directly from rock microstructure is integral to this technology. We survey recent development of the rotated staggered grid (RSG) finite-difference (FD) method for pore-scale simulation of elastic wave propagation in digital rock samples, including the dynamic elastic properties of rocks saturated with a viscous fluid. Examination of the accuracy of this algorithm on models with known analytical solutions provide an additional accuracy condition for numerical modeling on the microscale. We use both the elastic and viscoelastic versions of the RSG algorithm to study gas hydrates and to simulate propagation of Biot's slow wave. We applyRSG method ology to examine the effect of gas hydrate distributions in the pore space of a rock. We compare resulting P-wave velocities with experimentally measured data, as a basis for building an effective-medium model for rocks containing gas hydrates. We then perform numerical simulations of Biot's slow wave in a realistic 3D digital rock model, fully saturated with a nonviscous fluid (corresponding to the high-frequency limit of poroelasticity), and placed inside a bulk fluid. The model clearly demonstrates Biot's slow curve when the interface is open between the slab and bulk fluid. We demonstrate slow wave propagation in a porous medium saturated with a viscous fluid by analyzing an idealized 2D porous medium represented alternating solid and viscous fluid layers. Comparison of simulation results with the exact solution for this layered system shows good agreement over a broad frequency range.",10.1190/1.2753552
Enhanced Subsurface Response For Marine Csem Surveying,"One of the main challenges of using marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) sounding for hydrocarbon detection has been a relatively low-resolution and restricted depth penetration. In addition, the use of CSEM in shallow waters has been perceived as particularly difficult. A new, robust method for enhancing marine CSEM subsurface response is particularly useful in shallow waters. The method is designed to reduce acquisition imprints and attenuate the dominant primary airwave contribution. Synthetic examples show that it is possible to detect thin, deeply buried 3D resistive bodies in a shallow-water environment with a complex resistivity structure. The results highlight the importance of a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.",10.1190/1.3377054
3-D Electromagnetic Modeling For Near‐Surface Targets Using Integral Equations,"Three‐dimensional electromagnetic (EM) modeling in the frequency range from 100 kHz to about 200 MHz using integral equations is examined. The modeling algorithm is formulated in the frequency domain. Time‐domain responses for ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) and very early time time‐decaying transients are computed via Fourier transforms. Of vital importance to the modeling problem is the computation of the Hankel transforms in the Green's functions. The kernels of those Hankel transforms vary rapidly at high frequencies where displacement currents become important and are even singular for sources in the air, with poles approaching the real axis or branch cuts lying on the real axis. We use high density Hankel filters and a singularity extraction technique to circumvent these problems. Our modeling for GPR applications shows that dielectric targets are very obvious in radargrams, with waves reflected by target boundaries arriving at distinctive times, depending on the path they travel. While GPR signals are absorbed in conductive media, very early time‐transient responses can detect conducting targets in conductive media. Our modeling shows that 1-D shallow conductors can have large transient anomalies in the time window from 50 ns to 100 ms. Thus 1-D near‐surface conductors may be detected by conventional systems operating at μs ranges. However, shallow 3-D conductors of practical interest can have much earlier anomaly time windows around 100 ns. These targets can only be detected by very early time‐transient equipment. Moreover, very early time transients contain little information on dielectric permittivities, being primarily determined by the conductivities of the media. Thus GPR and very early time transients are excellent complements to each other.",10.1190/1.1444210
Gravity Exploration For Groundwater And Bedrock Topography In Glaciated Areas,"Gravity geophysics has useful application in mapping buried bedrock topography and in groundwater exploration in some specific geologic situations. One of these is the occurrence of groundwater in the sands and gravels of buried stream valleys on the bedrock surface, where there is an overburden such as glacial drift. We have evaluated the gravity method as an aid in glaciated terrain, to (a) locate local buried valleys for groundwater extraction, and (b) do reconnaissance surveying of the bedrock surface for a groundwater resource inventory. This has been done by modeling analysis and field research studies. For a gravity meter with sensitivity of .01 mgal, and with the standard corrections in field surveys, buried‐valley anomalies greater than about 0.14 mgal can be resolved. This requires that elevations be accurate to ±2 inches. For a drift/bedrock density contrast of 0.3g/cm3, valley depths greater than 45 ft can be identified. Data‐analysis techniques can be used to enhance the precision and applicability of the method, namely, (a) the use of theoretical diurnal earth‐tidal curves for gravity correction, in lieu of the less accurate and more time‐consuming empirical curves: (b) various least‐squares surface fittings to improve interpretation and compensate for errors in surface elevations; and (c) conversion of gravity anomaly data to bedrock elevations. Field studies here illustrate the use of gravity in locating a localized buried stream valley and in mapping bedrock under glacial drift in a reconnaissance survey of over 50 sq mi. In the latter, although elevation control was not available to precision, a useful residual anomaly map resulted from subtracting a 3rd degree (regional) surface from a 15th degree (smoothed‐elevation‐error) surface. The resulting gravity residual was accurate to ±0.15 mgal; the calculated relief on the bedrock surface is up to 250 ft, below about 200 to 300 ft of glacial drift.",10.1190/1.1440752
Estimating Depth And Excess‐Mass Of Point‐Sources And Horizontal Line‐Sources In Gravity Prospecting,"The problem of the exact quantitative determination of the depth p and total excess‐mass M of a point‐ and a line‐source is solved with the aid of moments of the mapped gravity anomaly gm, the correction for the regional anomaly being supposed as already applied. The solution does not presuppose that the constant error E in the regional datum is zero and this error is deduced from the gravity map itself. The relative errors which may affect the given estimates of p, M, E are studied and the magnitude of their upper limits is estimated in the case of a point‐source only since the same analysis can easily be extended to the case of a line‐source. The recommended method of solution reduces the harmful influence of extraneous anomalies from shallow mass points. The details of mathematical proofs are given in an appendix.",10.1190/1.1437240
Dip And Depth Extent Of Density Boundaries Using Horizontal Derivatives Of Upward‐Continued Gravity Data,"A new computer method was developed to derive values of dip and vertical extent, as well as location, for the truncated face of a horizontal‐plate model. The method is based on lateral offsets of the zero‐crossover point of the second horizontal derivative of an upward‐continued gravity profile. Application requires that the distance to the upper surface of the model be known. Numerical tests indicate useful results are obtained when both the length of the gravity profile, and the finite‐strike length of a model are at least three times the maximum depth extent of the model. Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 1 mGal can be tolerated given an anomaly amplitude of 70 mGal. An example from the Trans‐Hudson Orogen of central Manitoba, Canada, indicates that the Kisseynew metasedimentary gneisses extend over a vertical distance of 16–18 km, and are separated from the Baldock batholith to the north by a near‐vertical boundary.",10.1190/1.1442964
The Effect Of Oil Under In‐Situ Conditions On The Seismic Properties Of Rocks,"Direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHIs) on seismic sections are commonly thought to be diagnostic only of gas. However, oil sands can also generate DHIs such as bright spots and flat events since oils under in‐situ conditions can contain large amounts of solution gas. This dissolved gas substantially decreases the velocity of sound and the density of the oils as compared to measurements of these properties at surface conditions. Hydrocarbon indicators caused by oil sands are investigated by first measuring the elastic properties of an oil as a function of gas‐oil ratio, next, calculating the elastic properties of additional oil compositions under in‐situ conditions using standard pressure‐volume‐temperature (PVT) measurements, and then calculating the compressional velocity in oil‐saturated rocks for several typical oils using Gaasmann's equation. The potential for seismic anomalies caused by oil‐saturated rocks is higher than thought because the properties of oil under reservoir conditions can differ significantly from those of surface oils. Specifically: 1) The properties of oil depend on its composition: the higher the API gravity and the gas‐to‐oil ratio (GOR), the lower the density and velocity of sound (adiabatic bulk modulus) and the lower the velocity of a rock saturated with the oil. 2) Calculations of oil‐sand velocities using the in situ properties of oils show that areas having light oils and/or poorly consolidated rocks are the most likely areas in which to encounter oil DHIs. Since overpressured areas can have both poorly consolidated rocks and high GOR oils, they are especially prone to large oil responses.",10.1190/1.1443302
Three‐Dimensional Mise‐À‐La‐Masse Modeling Applied To Mapping Fracture Zones,"A numerical scheme applying the method of volume integral equations has been developed for borehole‐to‐borehole and borehole‐to‐surface modeling of the apparent resistivity response of a thin conductive body in a half‐space; the inhomogeneity simulates a fracture zone in a geothermal system. The algorithm is applicable for the direct‐current case when the buried electrode is either inside (mise‐à‐la‐masse) or outside (near‐miss) the body. In implementing the scheme, the integral equation is transformed into a matrix equation as a result of discretizing the inhomogeneity into rectangular cells. All physical properties are assumed constant within each cell. The rectangular cells are used through‐out execution of the algorithm. The computed surface and subsurface apparent resistivity responses are examined for bodies of similar shape and size but with different orientations: (1) vertical, (2) horizontal, (3) dipping at 60 degrees, and (4) dipping at 30 degrees. The four bodies produce apparent resistivity cross‐section plots which differ little from each other except in orientation. Varying the depth to the top of a body does not significantly alter the subsurface apparent resistivity response in the vicinity of the body. In both section and plan views, estimates of orientation, areal extent, and dip can often be made. The maximum depth at which a body can be located and still produce a detectable surface anomaly is dependent upon the position of the buried electrode and upon the contrast in conductivity. Locating the buried electrode just outside the body does not significantly alter the results from those when the electrode is embedded in the inhomogeneity. However, the similarity between the results of these two cases decreases as the distance between the electrode and the body is increased.",10.1190/1.1442044
Field Array Performance: Theoretical Study Of Spatially Correlated Variations In Amplitude Coupling And Static Shift And Case Study In The Paris Basin,"Near‐surface propagation anomalies degrade the performance of field arrays. We studied this problem by modeling the signal detected by a field array. In our model, the signal arrival time and amplitude were each varied with distance along the array according to some arbitrary spatial trend. Given the intensity and the correlation distance of the signal variations, both wavenumber selectivity for noise rejection and frequency response for desired signal can be calculated. We begin by describing diagnostic graphs that show an array's attainable signal bandwidth and noise rejection capability. Next, we discuss the mathematical relationships between the graphs and observable quantities such as correlations, array lengths, geophone spacing, etc. Exponential correlation functions are used in the modeling study for illustrative purposes. The same diagnostics are then generated from measured correlations derived from experimental data acquired in the Paris Basin with a densely sampled geophone spread. We found that the bandwidth diagnostic was useful and easy to calculate for this data set. Data sets with stronger noise waves should allow an accurate calculation of noise rejection capability. The diagnostic graphs can help in choosing the number of channels, array length, and weighting in a particular exploration area.",10.1190/1.1442671
"Alford Rotation, Ray Theory, And Crossed‐Dipole Geometry","Two generalizations of Alford rotation have been proposed for processing 2 × 2-component data containing nonorthogonal split shear waves: singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigenvector‐eigenvalue decomposition (EED). Using a simple crossed‐dipole synthetic model, we demonstrate that the physical model behind the EED method is invalid. It incorrectly assumes that a vector source aligned with the particle motion of an anisotropic pure mode will excite only that one mode. Ray theory shows that a vector point‐force source embedded in a homogeneous anisotropic medium instead excites all those modes with particle motions that are not perpendicular to the direction of the applied force, just as a vector point receiver detects all modes with polarizations that are not perpendicular to the receiver. Correctly generalized Alford rotation synthesizes vector sources and receivers such that each component is perpendicular to all but one of the pure modes of the medium. Although this ray‐theory result does not allow for the possibility of a source or receiver on a free surface and so is not yet completely general, it does apply to the idealized homogeneous crossed‐dipole geometry of our example. The new method, symmetric Alford diagonalization, differs from previous methods by becoming unstable when applied over excessively short time windows. This behavior is consistent with the physics of the problem: If nonorthogonal modes are allowed, then there is not enough information at a single time sample to determine a unique solution. Any method that can find a unique solution at a single time sample, including both the EED and SVD methods, does not respect the physics of the nonorthogonal problem. Although there appears to be no problem that recommends the EED method over standard Alford rotation for its solution, the SVD method is still applicable to the problem it was originally designed to solve: orthogonal modes with an unknown source or receiver orientation.",10.1190/1.1444954
Full‐Wave Acoustic Logging: Synthetic Microseismograms And Frequency‐Wavenumber Analysis,"The discrete wavenumber method is used to compute synthetic full‐waveform acoustic logs in axisymmetric multilayered boreholes and to perform the frequency‐wavenumber analysis of the radiated wave field. The stress‐displacement vector is propagated through the layers using a numerically improved formulation of the Thomson‐Haskell method. In the time domain, all the trapped and interface modes overlap. On the contrary, the representations of the spectral energy density of the scattered wave field in the frequency axial‐wavenumber domain, for various radial positions of observation, allow the recognition and identification of the different wave types as well as their repartition of energy. In particular, these diagrams show the close relation between the resonance frequencies of the borehole and the significant low‐frequency energy of the pseudo‐Rayleigh modes. They also facilitate the interpretation of some of the physical phenomena which occur during the propagation in a complex borehole environment. We present the configurations of a well‐bonded and unbonded cased hole, an invaded zone, and a mudcake. For all of these models, we consider a ""fast"" formation in which the S-wave velocity is higher than the bore fluid velocity and a ""slow"" formation. The presence of an elastic tool at the center of the borehole is also investigated.  The associated microseismograms, computed for a series of source‐receiver spacings, characterize in the time domain the observations previously made.",10.1190/1.1441865
"Audiomagnetotelluric Prospecting For Groundwater In The Baril Coastal Area, Piton De La Fournaise Volcano, Reunion Island","Surface geophysics has been used for a number of years to solve a variety of major groundwater exploration problems in coastal and island regions. The electrical properties of near‐surface rocks are highly dependent on porosity, degree of saturation, and pore fluid resistivity (Keller and Frischknecht, 1966). Because the resistivity of the formations decreases with increasing salinity of the water content, electrical methods, such as vertical electrical soundings, time‐domain electromagnetic soundings, and audiomagnetotellurics (AMT), are well‐suited for mapping changes in groundwater salinity and, in particular, for detecting a fresh water‐salt water interface.",10.1190/1.1444185
Air‐Gun Bubble Damping By A Screen,"A method for damping unwanted bubble oscillations from a seismic air gun is presented. The method exploits the fact that the primary pressure peak generated by an air gun is produced during the first 5–10 ms after firing. The air bubble is destroyed by mounting a perforated screen with an optimal radius about the gun. Once the primary pressure peak has been generated by the bubble, the bubble is destroyed by the screen, leading to a corresponding decrease in the measured pressure amplitude of the secondary bubble oscillations. Controlled near‐field measurements of 40‐cubic inch and 120‐cubic inch air guns with and without damping screens are used. The primary to bubble ratio improves from 1.4 without a screen to 4.4 with a screen in the near‐field. The corresponding values for estimated far‐field signatures are 1.8 to 9.0 when the signatures are filtered with an out‐128 Hz (72 dB/Oct) DFS V filter.",10.1190/1.1443910
Incomplete Avo Near Salt Structures,"Amplitude versus offset (AVO) measurements for deep hydrocarbon‐bearing sands can be compromised when made in close proximity to a shallow salt piercement structure. Anomalous responses are observed, particularly on low acoustic impedance bright spots. CMP data from key seismic profiles traversing the bright spots do not show the expected Class 3 offset responses. On these CMPs, significant decrease of far trace energy is observed. CMP data from other seismic profiles off‐structure do exhibit the Class 3 offset responses, implying that structural complications may be interfering with the offset response. A synthetic AVO gather was generated using well log data, which supports the off‐structure Class 3 responses, further reinforcing the concept of structurally‐biased AVO responses. Acoustic, pseudo‐spectral modeling of the structure substantiates the misleading AVO response. Pseudo‐spectral modeling results suggest that signal degradation observed on the far offsets is caused by wavefield refraction—a shadow zone, where the known hydrocarbon‐bearing sands are not completely illuminated. Such shadow zones obscure the correct AVO response, which may have bearing on exploration and development.",10.1190/1.1443268
Background Resistivity Model From Seismic Velocities,"We developed a methodology to estimate resistivities from seismic velocities. We applied known methods, including rock physics, depth trends, structural information, and uncertainty analysis. The result is the range of background resistivity models that is consistent with the known seismic velocities. We successfully tested the methodology with real data from the North Sea. These 2D or 3D background resistivity models yield a detailed insight into the background resistivity, and they are a powerful tool for feasibility studies. They could also serve as starting models or constraints in (iterative) forward modeling of electromagnetic data for the determination of subsurface resistivities.",10.1190/geo2012-0445.1
A Novel Approach To Seismic Signal Processing And Modeling,"This paper demonstrates some results obtained using state‐variable models and techniques on problems for which solutions either cannot be or are not easily obtained via more conventional input‐output techniques. After a brief introduction to state‐variable notions, the following seven problem areas are discussed: modeling seismic source wavelets, simultaneous deconvolution and correction for spherical divergence, simultaneous wavelet estimation and deconvolution, well log processing, design of recursive Wiener filters, Bremmer series decomposition of a seismogram (including suppression of multiples and vertical seismic profiling), and estimating reflection coefficients and traveltimes.",10.1190/1.1441147
Pore-Scale Modeling Of Elastic Wave Propagation In Carbonate Rocks,"The relationship between P-wave velocity and porosity in carbonate rocks shows a high degree of variability due to the complexity of the pore structure. This variability introduces high uncertainties to seismic inversion, amplitude variation with offset analysis, porosity estimation, and pore-pressure prediction based on velocity data. Elastic wave propagation in porous media is numerically modeled on the pore scale to investigate the effects of pore structure on P-wave velocities in carbonate rocks. We built 2D models of porous media using pore structure information and the similarity principle. Then, we simulated normal incidence wave propagation using finite element analysis. Finally, the velocity was determined from received modeled signals by means of crosscorrelation. The repeatability and accuracy of this modeling process was verified carefully. Based on the modeling results, a simple formulation of Sun's frame flexibility factor (γk), aspect ratio (AR, the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis), and pore density was developed. The numerical simulation results indicated that the P-wave velocity increases as a power function as the AR increases. Pores with small AR (0.1) or large γk created softening effects that decrease P-wave velocity significantly. The P-wave velocity of carbonate rocks was dispersive; it depends on the ratio of the wavelength to pore size (λ/d). Such scale-dependent dispersion was more evident for carbonate rocks with higher porosity, lower AR, and/or lower P-wave impedance of pore fluids. The P-wave velocity of carbonate rocks with complicated pore geometries (low AR, high γk, small d) was much lower than that of rocks with simple pore geometries (high AR, small γk, large d) at low and high λ/d. The pore-scale modeling of elastic wave properties of porous rocks may explain the poor velocity-porosity correlation in carbonate rocks.",10.1190/geo2014-0050.1
Microgravity Investigations Of Foundation Conditions,"A microgravity investigation was conducted in the upstream and downstream switchyards of the Wilson Dam powerplant, Florence, Alabama. The objective of the survey was the detection in the switchyard foundations of subsurface cavities or other anomalous conditions that could threaten the stability of the switchyard structures. The survey consisted of 288 gravity stations in the downstream switchyard and 347 stations in the upstream switchyard. Significant anomalous areas in the switchyards were selected on the basis of residual gravity anomaly maps. These results were prioritized and used to guide an exploratory drilling program to investigate the cause of the anomalies. Highest‐priority boring location recommendations were in negative gravity anomaly areas, since negative anomalies could be caused by actual cavities or low‐density zones that might represent incipient cavity formation. Remaining boring locations were in positive anomaly areas for verification purposes. The results of the borings confirm the presence of cavities and soft zones indicative of cavity formation.",10.1190/1.1444331
Seismic Wave Propagation Concepts Applied To The Interpretation Of Marine Controlled-Source Electromagnetics,"Concepts such as reflections, refractions, diffractions, and transmissions are very useful for the interpretation of seismic data. Moreover, these concepts play a key role in the design of processing algorithms for seismic data. Currently, however, the same concepts are not widely used for the analysis and interpretation of marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) data. Connections between seismic and marine CSEM data are established by analytically transforming the diffusive Maxwell equations to wave-domain Maxwell equations. Seismic data and wave-domain electromagnetic data are simulated with 3D finite-difference schemes. The two data types are similar; however, the wave-domain electromagnetic data must be transformed back to the diffusive domain to properly describe realistic field propagation in the earth. We analyzed the inverse transform from the wave domain to the diffusive domain. Concepts like reflections, refractions, diffractions and transmissions were found to be valid also for marine CSEM data but the properties of the inverse transform favored refracted and guided events over reflected and diffracted events. In this sense, marine CSEM data were found to be similar to refraction seismic data.",10.1190/geo2014-0215.1
Mapping Lithofacies And Pore‐Fluid Probabilities In A North Sea Reservoir: Seismic Inversions And Statistical Rock Physics,"Reliably predicting lithologic and saturation heterogeneities is one of the key problems in reservoir characterization. In this study, we show how statistical rock physics techniques combined with seismic information can be used to classify reservoir lithologies and pore fluids. One of the innovations was to use a seismic impedance attribute (related to the VP/VS ratio) that incorporates far‐offset data, but at the same time can be practically obtained using normal incidence inversion algorithms. The methods were applied to a North Sea turbidite system. We incorporated well log measurements with calibration from core data to estimate the near‐offset and far‐offset reflectivity and impedance attributes. Multivariate probability distributions were estimated from the data to identify the attribute clusters and their separability for different facies and fluid saturations. A training data was set up using Monte Carlo simulations based on the well log—derived probability distributions. Fluid substitution by Gassmann's equation was used to extend the training data, thus accounting for pore fluid conditions not encountered in the well. Seismic inversion of near‐offset and far‐offset stacks gave us two 3‐D cubes of impedance attributes in the interwell region. The near‐offset stack approximates a zero‐offset section, giving an estimate of the normal incidence acoustic impedance. The far offset stack gives an estimate of a VP/VS‐related elastic impedance attribute that is equivalent to the acoustic impedance for non‐normal incidence. These impedance attributes obtained from seismic inversion were then used with the training probability distribution functions to predict the probability of occurrence of the different lithofacies in the interwell region. Statistical classification techniques, as well as geostatistical indicator simulations were applied on the 3‐D seismic data cube. A Markov‐Bayes technique was used to update the probabilities obtained from the seismic data by taking into account the spatial correlation as estimated from the facies indicator variograms. The final results are spatial 3‐D maps of not only the most likely facies and pore fluids, but also their occurrence probabilities. A key ingredient in this study was the exploitation of physically based seismic‐to‐reservoir property transforms optimally combined with statistical techniques.",10.1190/1.1487078
Application Of The Perfectly Matched Absorbing Layer Model To The Linear Elastodynamic Problem In Anisotropic Heterogeneous Media,"We present and analyze a perfectly matched, absorbing layer model for the velocity‐stress formulation of elastodynamics. The principal idea of this method consists of introducing an absorbing layer in which we decompose each component of the unknown into two auxiliary components: a component orthogonal to the boundary and a component parallel to it. A system of equations governing these new unknowns then is constructed. A damping term finally is introduced for the component orthogonal to the boundary. This layer model has the property of generating no reflection at the interface between the free medium and the artificial absorbing medium. In practice, both the boundary condition introduced at the outer boundary of the layer and the dispersion resulting from the numerical scheme produce a small reflection which can be controlled even with very thin layers. As we will show with several experiments, this model gives very satisfactory results; namely, the reflection coefficient, even in the case of heterogeneous, anisotropic media, is about 1% for a layer thickness of five space discretization steps.",10.1190/1.1444908
Practical Aspects And Applications Of 2D Stereotomography,"Stereotomography is a new velocity estimation method. This tomographic approach aims at retrieving subsurface velocities from prestack seismic data. In addition to traveltimes, the slope of locally coherent events are picked simultaneously in common offset, common source, common receiver, and common midpoint gathers. As the picking is realized on locally coherent events, they do not need to be interpreted in terms of reflection on given interfaces, but may represent diffractions or reflections from anywhere in the image. In the high‐frequency approximation, each one of these events corresponds to a ray trajectory in the subsurface. Stereotomography consists of picking and analyzing these events to update both the associated ray paths and velocity model. In this paper, we describe the implementation of two critical features needed to put stereotomography into practice: an automatic picking tool and a robust multiscale iterative inversion technique. Applications to 2D reflection seismic are presented on synthetic data and on a 2D line extracted from a 3D towed streamer survey shot in West Africa for TotalFinaElf. The examples demonstrate that the method requires only minor human intervention and rapidly converges to a geologically plausible velocity model in these two very different and complex velocity regimes. The quality of the velocity models is verified by prestack depth migration results.",10.1190/1.1581072
Total Variation Regularization For Depth-To-Basement Estimate: Part 1 — Mathematical Details And Applications,"We have developed an inversion approach that estimates the basement relief of a fault-bounded sedimentary basin. The sedimentary pack is approximated by a grid of 3D or 2D vertical prisms juxtaposed in the horizontal directions of a right-handed coordinate system. The prisms' thicknesses represent the depths to the basement and are the parameters to be estimated from the gravity data. To obtain depth-to-basement estimates, we introduce the total variation (TV) regularization as a stabilizing function. This approach lets us estimate a nonsmooth basement relief because it does not penalize sharp features of the solution. We have deduced a compact matrix form of the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix of the approximation to the TV function that allows a regularized Gauss-Newton minimization approach. Because the Hessian matrix of the approximation to the TV function is ill conditioned, we have modified this Hessian matrix to improve its condition and to accelerate the convergence of the Gauss-Newton algorithm. Tests conducted with synthetic data show that the inversion method can delineate discontinuous basements presenting large slips or sequences of small-slip step faults. Tests on field data from the Almada Basin, Brazil, and from the San Jacinto Graben, California, U.S.A., confirm the potential of the method in detecting and locating in-depth normal faults in the basement relief of a sedimentary basin.",10.1190/1.3524286
An Improved Technique For Reduction To The Pole At Low Latitudes,"Reduction to the pole at low latitudes based on a Wiener filtering approach has been improved by introducing a deterministic noise model. It is assumed that the noise power is a fixed fraction of the signal power. This allows the method to be fully automated. Further improvement is obtained by requiring the reduced‐to‐the‐pole field to map into the observed field when projected to the geomagnetic latitude of the observed field. This is done by iteratively minimizing the difference between the measured field and the reduced‐to‐the‐pole field projected to the geomagnetic latitude of the measured data. This results in a reduced‐to‐the‐pole magnetic map that, when projected to the geomagnetic latitude of the given data, closely matches the measured data. The final reduced‐to‐the‐pole field does not show any of the artifacts typical of reduction‐to‐the‐pole at low geomagnetic latitudes. The method is demonstrated on a data set from an aeromagnetic survey flown over north‐central Burkina Faso, West Africa.",10.1190/1.1443933
Seismic Data Enhancement—A Case History,"The theory relating to many methods—for example, multiple seismometer techniques—which the geophysicist may control to improve record quality is well known. However, its application has not been fully exploited. An example of the reduction of theory to practice in one area characterized by poor records is presented. It comprises a series of analytical tests designed to discover the cause of poor records, to examine the effect of each variable on the signal‐to‐noise ratio, and to evaluate the solutions predicted by theory. The tests showed that the poor record quality was attributable chiefly to relatively strong surface and near‐surface waves propagating outward from the shot. Wave length filtering by means of suitable shot and seismometer patterns, and compositing through data processing methods, greatly improved record quality and permitted magnetic recording of reflected signals over a broad frequency range. The tests established, in the allotted time, that the quality of the data would meet clearly specified standards of performance. Experience has shown that better seismic data can generally be obtained when the design of techniques is based on the special character of the signal and noise determined from simple tests rather than when the design is based on general assumptions.",10.1190/1.1438695
Velocity Analysis With Vertical Seismic Profile Data Using Migration Of Surface-Related Multiples,"We have developed an original method for migration velocity analysis for vertical seismic profile (VSP) data. The method is based on VSP imaging with the primary reflected data and surface-related multiples. Velocity updates are carried out by matching the images obtained by these two types of waves. To do it automatically, we have introduced an objective function of the crosscorrelation type and developed a gradient-based maximization algorithm. On synthetic walk-away VSP data sets, we found that maximization of the crosscorrelation of the images provided by the two different types of waves allowed the retrieval of the interval velocities below the borehole receivers — a problem that was considered to be challenging with a VSP acquisition. Also, the possibility of the lateral velocity gradient reconstruction was developed on a simple synthetic model. On the real walk-away VSP data set from the North Sea, we found that the method could also be used for estimation of effective anisotropy parameters below the borehole receivers. In all of our examples, the velocity model refinement based on the presented method led to significant improvements of the seismic images.",10.1190/geo2015-0107.1
"Written Discussion, Symposium On Mining Geophysics","New York, N. Y.-Commonly oil and ore are associated with planar geologic features, the dip of which is slight for oil and steep for ore. Thus did Dr. Heiland in his introductory remarks aptly generalize the difference in geometry of occurrence of oil and ore which is critical in the design of exploration for them.",10.1190/1.13040001.1
Multicomponent Seismic Studies Using Complex Trace Analysis,"The methods of complex signal analysis are applicable to multicomponent trace is defined by real orthogonal components derived by applying the Hilbert transform to the real components. Polarization attributes, including the instantaneous phase difference, signed reciprocal ellipiticity, tilt angle, and rise angle, can be displayed in trace format or in radial time-attribute plots. Polarization attributes are readily interpreted despite the non‐stationary character of seismic signals. Average attributes are defined by weighting with the geometric mean of instantaneous amplitudes. Multicomponent walkaway data have been obtained by detonating explosives in air and using triaxial in‐clined (Galp´erin) geophones on a mud flat in the Great Salt Lake Desert, Utah. Polarization attributes of these data define some of the principal characteristics of both ambient noise and source‐generated waves. The direct, critical refraction, and reflection events show linear polarization with a slight forward tilt of the particle motion. Polarization of the air wave and the initial por‐tion of the air‐coupled wave is consistent across all traces in the walkaway data. The air wave begins with prograde particle motion; after approximately 2 1/2 cycles, particle motion changes to a retrogade elliptic phase. In the data considered, most of the air‐coupledwave is due to higher modes of the Rayleigh wave ( M3, M4,…). The M1 and M2 modes generated in the immediate vicinity of the explosive source exhibit opposite polarities of phase difference, corresponding to retrograde and prograde elliptic particle motions, respectively. By zeroing all data with average signed reciprocal ellipticity outside the range between −0.125 and −1, the M2 waves are automatically selected for subsequent display with little contamination by other waves. Such procedures facilitate identification of waves according to their polarization characteristics. A desert mud flat may provide an excellent environment for study of Rayleigh waves, including air‐coupled waves, due to its flat terrain, sparse vegetation, and lateral uniformity of sediments.",10.1190/1.1442177
"Aeromagnetic Prospecting For Iron Ore On Eyre Peninsula, South Australia",The analysis of anomalies on the aeromagnetic survey maps of the Middleback Ranges and other areas of Eyre Peninsula in South Australia which were flown in the search for iron‐ore deposits has provided depth estimates which are in good agreement with known and later discovered geological facts. The average error involved in these estimates is of the order of 15 percent.,10.1190/1.1439234
A Note On The Propagation Of Seismic Waves,It is suggested that in the computation of theoretical time‐distance curves for seismic wave propagation a more tractable form of analysis is obtained if the depth is expressed as a power series in the velocity than when the converse but more conventional method is used. Several illustrations of this procedure are given.,10.1190/1.1438098
Focusing Geophysical Inversion Images,"A critical problem in inversion of geophysical data is developing a stable inverse problem solution that can simultaneously resolve complicated geological structures. The traditional way to obtain a stable solution is based on maximum smoothness criteria. This approach, however, provides smoothed unfocused images of real geoelectrical structures. Recently, a new approach to reconstruction of images has been developed based on a total variational stabilizing functional. However, in geophysical applications it still produces distorted images. In this paper we develop a new technique to solve this problem which we call focusing inversion images. It is based on specially selected stabilizing functionals, called minimum gradient support (MGS) functionals, which minimize the area where strong model parameter variations and discontinuity occur. We demonstrate that the MGS functional, in combination with the penalization function, helps to generate clearer and more focused images for geological structures than conventional maximum smoothness or total variation functionals. The method has been successfully tested on synthetic models and applied to real gravity data.",10.1190/1.1444596
Generalized F-K (Frequency‐Wavenumber) Migration In Arbitrarily Varying Media,"Migration requires one‐way wave continuation. In the spatial domain, one‐way wave equations are derived based on various approximations to an assumed dispersion relation. In the frequency‐wavenumber domain, the well known f-k method and the phase‐shift method are strictly valid only within homogeneous models and layered models, respectively. In this paper, a frequency‐wavenumber domain method is presented for one‐way wave continuation in arbitrarily varying media. In the method, the downward continuation is accomplished, not with plane waves individually as in the f-k or the phase‐shift method, but with the whole spectrum of plane waves simultaneously in order to account for the coupling among the plane waves due to lateral inhomogeneity. The method is based on a matrix integral equation. The method has the following merits: (1) The method is a generalization of the f-k and the phase‐shift methods, valid in arbitrarily varying models. (2) The method has physical interpretations in terms of upgoing and downgoing plane waves, and as such the method has well defined steps leading from full‐wave continuation (two‐way wave) to one‐way wave continuation for migration. (3) The method is rigorous; the only approximations in the method—other than the one‐way wave approximation necessary for migration—are the discretization of a continuous system (which is necessary in computer methods) and imperfections associated with the limited spatial aperture of the data; as such, the method can achieve high solution accuracy. (4) The method can be fast, since computations are mainly matrix‐vector multiplications, which are easily vectorizable. In particular, compared to spatial domain methods, I contend that the method is (1) more rigorous in one‐way wave theory, (2) more accurate in migration of high‐dip events, and (3) faster for smooth models. I applied the method to a few examples of zero‐offset data migration, including imaging a point diffractor below a dipping interface, migration with sharp lateral variations in velocity, and migration with smooth lateral variations in velocity.",10.1190/1.1442436
"Processing, Inversion, And Interpretation Of A 2D Seismic Data Set From The North Viking Graben, North Sea","The Vp/Vs–Swv plane still does not produce unique interpretation in many situations. However, the critical distinction, which is between hydrocarbon‐bearing sands and all other geologic/reservoir configurations, is defined. Swv ≤ 0.17 and Vp/Vs ≤ 1.8 are the criteria that delineate potential reservoirs in this area, with decreasing Swv indicating a higher gas/oil ratio, and decreasing Vp/Vs indicating a higher sand/shale ratio. As these criteria are locally calibrated, they appear to be valid locally; they should not be applied to other data sets, which may exhibit significantly different relationships. However, the overall procedure should be generally applicable.",10.1190/1.1581036
In‐Situ Holographic Elastic Moduli Measurements From Boreholes,"We have developed a unique technique employing optical holography to measure the static Young's modulus (E) from a borehole. In the experiment, a known point force induces micron scale displacements on the borehole wall which are recorded by a double‐exposure hologram. Raw data consist of dark fringes superimposed on the three‐dimensional image whose pattern is modeled to find E directly. In the laboratory, the holographic technique determined E on rock and metal samples to an uncertainty better than 10 percent. For example, double exposure holograms of a saw‐cut sample of dolomitic marlstone gave an E of 16.8 ± 2.8 GPa in agreement with 17.2 ± 2.0 GPa predicted by published density‐modulus relationships. Field tests of a holographic tool in a horizontal mine pillar borehole gave in‐situ Es which range from 26.9 to 36.0 GPa. Although these data could be interpreted as localized elastic heterogeneity within the rock mass, elastic anisotropy of the rock is a possible explanation for this variation.",10.1190/1.1442673
Geophysical Activity In 1967 Applied To Petroleum Exploration,"The various categories of Geophysical Activities for 1967 covered in this or in corollary reports are Petroleum; Mining; Engineering, Construction, and Ground Water; and Oceanographic Surveys. Data are fairly complete for most groups, and reasonable reliance can be placed on the numbers. Items such as cost, though, are partly estimated. If anything, they are on the conservative side.",10.1190/1.1439982
Inline Delayed-Shot Migration In Tilted Elliptical-Cylindrical Coordinates,"Riemannian wavefield extrapolation, a one-way wave-equation method for propagating seismic data on generalized coordinate systems, is extended to inline delayed-shot migration using 3D tilted elliptical-cylindrical (TEC) coordinate meshes. Compared to Cartesian geometries, TEC coordinates are more conformal to the shape of inline delayed-source impulse response, which allows the bulk of wavefield energy to propagate at angles lower to the extrapolation axis, thus improving global propagation accuracy. When inline coordinate tilt angles are well matched to the inline source ray parameters, the TEC coordinate extension affords accurate propagation of both steep-dip and turning-wave components important for successfully imaging complex geologic structure. Wavefield extrapolation in TEC coordinates is no more complicated than propagation in elliptically anisotropic media and can be handled by existing implicit finite-difference methods. Impulse response tests illustrate the phase accuracy of the method and show that the approach is free of numerical anisotropy. Migration tests from a realistic 3D wide-azimuth synthetic derived from a field Gulf of Mexico data set demonstrate the imaging advantages afforded by the technique, including the improved imaging of steeply dipping salt flanks at a reduced computational cost.",10.1190/1.3481763
Estimation Of Elastic Stiffness Coefficients Of An Orthorhombic Physical Model Using Group Velocity Analysis On Transmission Data,"We acquired 3C ultrasonic transmission seismograms, measured group velocities associated with the three quasi-body wave types, and determined density-normalized stiffness coefficients (Aij=Cij/ρ) over an orthorhombic physical (laboratory) model. The estimation of Aij is based on an approximate relationship between the nine orthorhombic Aij and group velocities. Estimation of the anisotropic Aij is usually done using phase velocities with well-known formulas expressing their theoretical dependence on Aij. However, on time-domain seismograms, arrivals are observed traveling with group velocities. Group velocity measurements are found to be straightforward, reasonably accurate, and independent of the size of the transducers used. In contrast, the accuracy of phase velocities derived from the (τ,p) transform analysis was found to be very sensitive to small differences in picked arrival times and to transducer size. Theoretical phase and group velocities, calculated in a forward manner from the Aij estimates, agreed with the originally measured phase and group velocities, respectively. This agreement confirms that it is valid to use easily measured group velocities with their approximate theoretical relationship to the Aij to determine the full stiffness matrix. Compared to the phase-velocity procedure, the technique involving group velocities is much less prone to error due to time-picking uncertainties, and therefore is more suitable for analyzing physical model seismic data.",10.1190/geo2013-0203.1
Quantifying Total Sulfide Content Of Cores And Cut-Rock Surfaces Using Thermal Infrared Reflectance,"In this study, core samples of sulfide-rich zones were delineated from their host rock and a quantitative estimation of sulfide content on cut-rock faces was made using thermal infrared reflectance (TIR;   3.0–30 μm   region) spectroscopy. Core sections and rocks were collected from mines in the Sudbury basin, Ontario, Canada. The TSC% (areal percentage of total sulfide content) of each sample was then estimated by summing the modal abundance of all sulfide minerals (chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, and pentlandite). TIR at   1319  cm−1      ( TIR1319 )   is linearly related to TSC%. The average of the spectral ratios    TIR995 ∕ TIR1319    and    TIR1180 ∕ TIR1319      ( TIRratio )   is related exponentially to TSC%. The coefficients of determination   ( R2 )   based on a calibration data set are 0.90 and 0.87, respectively. Two models were tested, the  TIR1319  model and the  TIRindex  model; the latter combines  TIR1319  and  TIRratio . The value for  R2  for predicted TSC% versus observed TSC% (from thin sections) is 0.98 and 0.97, respectively, with little or no bias. The standard deviation of the residuals is 3.1 and 3.5 TSC%, respectively. The  TIR1319  model is preferred over the  TIRindex  model because it is linear and therefore does not have the problem with insensitivity at low TSC% that the exponential  TIRratio  model has. In addition, from the viewpoint of developing an instrument for automated core logging, the  TIR1319  model requires measurements at only one wavelength rather than three and hence requires a less expensive instrument.",10.1190/1.2195990
Theoretical Seismic Wave Radiation From A Fluid‐Filled Borehole,"This paper concerns far‐field radiation of compressional P and shear S waves into the surrounding medium from a fluid‐filled borehole in an infinite medium and tube waves propagating along a borehole, using a low‐frequency approximation. Two kinds of sources are considered: (1) a volume displacement point source acting on the axis of a borehole, and (2) a uniform radial stress source acting on the wall of a borehole. When the tube‐wave velocity is close to the shear‐wave velocity, the effect of the borehole fluid on the P‐wave radiation pattern and on the S‐wave radiation pattern is substantial.",10.1190/1.1441391
Modeling Compaction Effects On The Elastic Properties Of Clay-Water Composites,"Modeling the elastic properties of clay-bearing rocks (shales) requires thorough knowledge of the mineral constituents, their elastic properties, pore space microstructure, and orientations of clay platelets. Information about these variables and their complex interrelationships is rarely available for real rocks. We theoretically modeled the elastic properties of synthetic clay-water composites compacted in the laboratory, including estimates of pore space topology and percolation behavior. The mineralogy of the samples was known exactly, and the focus was on two monomineralic samples comprised of kaolinite and smectite. We used differential effective medium theory (DEM) and analysis of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the compacted kaolinite and smectite samples. Percolation behavior was included through calculations of critical porosities from measurements of the liquid limits of the individual clay powders. Quantitative analysis of the SEM images showed that the large scale (0.1  μm) pore space of the smectite composite had more rounded pores (mean aspect ratio α=0.55) than the kaolinite composite (mean pore's aspect ratio α=0.44). However, models that used only these large-scale pore shapes could not explain the compressional and shear velocity measurements. DEM simulations with a single pore aspect ratio showed that bulk and shear moduli are controlled by different pore shapes. Conversely, modeling results that combined critical porosity and dual porosity models into DEM theory compared well with the measured bulk and shear moduli of compacting kaolinite and smectite composites. The methods and results we used could be used to model unconsolidated clay-bearing rocks of more complex mineralogy.",10.1190/geo2011-0426.1
Vector-Migration Of Standard Copolarized 3D Gpr Data,"The derivation of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images in which the amplitudes of reflections and diffractions are consistent with subsurface electromagnetic property contrasts requires migration algorithms that correctly account for the antenna radiation patterns and the vectorial character of electromagnetic wavefields. Most existing vector-migration techniques are based on far-field approximations of Green's functions, which are inappropriate for the majority of GPR applications. We have recently developed a method for rapidly computing practically exact-field Green's functions in a multicomponent vector migration scheme. A significant disadvantage of this scheme is the extra effort needed to record, process, and migrate at least two components of GPR data. By making straightforward modifications to the multi-component algorithm, we derive an equivalent exact-field sin-gle-component vector-migration scheme that can be applied to most standard GPR data acquired using a single copolarized antenna pair. Our new formulation is valid for polarization-independent features (e.g., most point scatterers, spheres, and planar objects), but not for polarization-dependent ones (e.g., most underground public utilities). A variety of tests demonstrates the stability of the exact-field single-component operators. Applications of the new scheme to synthetic and field-recorded GPR data containing dipping planar reflections produce images that are virtually identical to the corresponding multicomponent vector-migrated images and are almost invariant to the relative orientations of antennas and reflectors. The new single-component vector-migration scheme is appropriate for migrating the majority of GPR data acquired by researchers and practitioners.",10.1190/1.2766466
Bayesian Inversion Of Csem And Magnetotelluric Data,"We have developed a Bayesian methodology for inversion of controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) data and magnetotelluric (MT) data. The inversion method provided optimal solutions and also the associated uncertainty for any sets of electric and magnetic components and frequencies from CSEM and MT data. The method is based on a 1D forward modeling method for the electromagnetic (EM) response for a plane-layered anisotropic earth model. The inversion method was also designed to invert common midpoint (CMP)-sorted data along a 2D earth profile assuming locally horizontal models in each CMP position. The inversion procedure simulates from the posterior distribution using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) approach based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The method that we use integrates available geologic prior knowledge with the information in the electromagnetic data such that the prior model stabilizes and constrains the inversion according to the described knowledge. The synthetic examples demonstrated that inclusion of more data generally improves the inversion results. Compared to inversion of the inline electric component only, inclusion of broadside and magnetic components and an extended set of frequency components moderately decreased the uncertainty of the inversion. The results were strongly dependent on the prior knowledge imposed by the prior distribution. The prior knowledge about the background resistivity model surrounding the target was highly important for a successful and reliable inversion result.",10.1190/geo2010-0298.1
Early Seismic Discoveries In Oklahoma,"Systematic seismic reflection shooting was begun on the Seminole Plateau of Oklahoma in 1927. In the beginning the results were somewhat undependable and well checks were disappointing. The various difficulties were gradually ironed out so that with the discovery of South Earlsboro in 1929 and the North Extension of Carr City and West Seminole in 1930, new impetus was given to the use of the method. The history of these discoveries together with maps and records show the measure of success obtained at that time. Data on the Polo Field, discovered in 1931 and detailed in 1934, are compared with this early work.",10.1190/1.1437176
Crustal Electrical Conductivities Along The Eastern Flank Of The Sierra Nevadas,"A unique controlled‐source experiment utilizing a high‐voltage dc transmission line and an array of three‐component variometers was used in an extensive low‐frequency electromagnetic (EM) survey along the eastern flank of the Sierra Nevada batholith. Complex image theory was used to interpret magnetic field data, obtained at over 90 stations, in terms of one‐dimensional (1-D) electrical conductivity models of the lower and upper crust. Electrical conductivities in the upper crust were found to be very high in the area between Mono Lake and the Coso geothermal area. The zones of high conductivity are narrow linear features which may be associated with conductive fluids within highly permeable shatter zones. These shatter zones are caused by extensive north‐south trending faults defining the eastern margin of the Sierra Nevada batholith. A profile line extending from the Sierra Nevada Mountains into Indian Wells Valley suggests that the electrical conductivity of the crust increases sharply on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada fault zone. This may be indicative of processes in the deep crust and upper mantle associated with extension of the Basin and Range province westward to this point. South of the Garlock fault zone, the overall crustal conductivity is low. However, high‐conductivity anomalies of shallow origin are seen in many places. These are interpreted as the effects of conductive sediments such as those filling the San Joaquin Valley, combined with complicated current systems flowing within major fault zones.",10.1190/1.1440942
Simulations Of Noise Rejection And Mantissa‐Only Recording: An Experiment In High‐Amplitude Noise Reduction With Cocorp Data,"Vertical stacking of Vibroseis® sweeps for the purposes of reflection data enhancement and data compression often smears sporadic noise bursts into summed traces with degrading effects. One noisy record can easily nullify the signal enhancement benefits of stacking the remaining good sweeps (e.g., Gimlin and Smith, 1980). This paper compares different methods of noise editing before vertical stacking, as applied to deep seismic data collected by COCORP (Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling) in conditions of heavy traffic noise. Noise editing is of particular concern in crustal seismic work where weak reflections from great depths are often critical to interpretations. In our test, individual sweeps rather than the field sum of these sweeps were recorded separately on tape. This procedure, single‐sweep recording, allowed four computer simulations: (A) recording with no noise editing; (B) recording with a field noise‐rejection (NRJ) system; (C) using a more optimal NRJ system which was computed using the characteristics of the recorded sweeps and applied after recording; and (D) recording using mantissa‐only (MO) format. In this initial, limited experiment, we found significantly greater noise reduction with both tailored, postrecording NRJ systems and MO format than with the simple field NRJ currently employed by COCORP. Normally, these alternative recording methods are not used, either because they entail excessive tape handling and preprocessing, as in the case of single‐sweep recording and application of postrecording NRJ, or because they entail loss of dynamic range, as with MO format recording. However, this study suggests that in the presence of severe traffic noise the benefits of these alternative techniques may outweigh their drawbacks.",10.1190/1.1441946
Pore-Scale Modeling Of Electrical And Fluid Transport In Berea Sandstone,"The purpose of this paper is to test how well numerical calculations can predict transport properties of porous permeable rock, given its 3D digital microtomography   (μCT)   image. For this study, a Berea 500 sandstone sample is used, whose   μCT   images have been obtained with resolution of   2.8 μm  . Porosity, electrical conductivity, permeability, and surface area are calculated from the   μCT   image and compared with laboratory-measured values. For transport properties (electrical conductivity, permeability), a finite-difference scheme is adopted. The calculated and measured properties compare quite well. Electrical transport in Berea 500 sandstone is complicated by the presence of surface conduction in the electric double layer at the grain-electrolyte boundary. A three-phase conductivity model is proposed to compute surface conduction on the rock   μCT   image. Effects of image resolution and computation sample size on the accuracy of numerical predictions are also investigated. Reducing resolution (i.e., increasing the voxel dimensions) decreases the calculated values of electrical conductivity and hydraulic permeability. Increasing computation sample volume gives a better match between laboratory measurements and numerical results. Large sample provides a better representation of the rock.",10.1190/1.3463704
"Surface-Downhole Electrical Resistivity Tomography Applied To Monitoring Of Co2 Storage At Ketzin, Germany","Surface-downhole electrical resistivity tomography (SD-ERT) surveys were repeatedly carried out to image CO2 injected at the pilot storage Ketzin, Germany. The experimental setup combines surface with downhole measurements by using a permanent electrode array that has been deployed in three wells. Two baseline experiments were performed during the site startup and three repeat experiments were performed during the first year of CO2 injection. By the time of the third repeat, approximately 13,500 tons of CO2 had been injected into the reservoir sandstones at about 650 m depth. Field data and inverted resistivity models showed a resistivity increase over time at the CO2 injector. The lateral extent of the related resistivity signature indicated a preferential CO2 migration toward the northwest. Using an experimental resistivity-saturation relationship, we mapped CO2 saturations by means of the resistivity index method. For the latest repeat, CO2 saturations show values of up to 70% near the injection well, which matches well with CO2 saturations determined from pulsed neutron-gamma logging. The presence of environmental noise, reservoir heterogeneities, and irregularities in the well completions are the main sources of uncertainty for the interpretations. The degradation of the permanently installed downhole components is monitored by means of frequently performed resistance checks. In consistency with the SD-ERT data, these resistance checks indicate a long-term resistivity increase near the CO2 injector. In conclusion, the investigations demonstrate the capability of surface-downhole electrical resistivity tomography to image geologically stored CO2 at the Ketzin site.",10.1190/geo2011-0515.1
A Proposed Method Of Measuring The Derivatives Of The Earth'S Magnetic Field,The method of measuring the derivatives of the earth's magnetic field which is proposed depends on the fact that a small steady magnetic field will modify the e.m.f. induced in the secondary coil of a detector with a core of magnetizable material possessing high initial permeability and a high rate of increase of the permeability with the strength of the magnetizing field. It is shown that a detector of this type is equivalent to an inductor coil rotating with angular speed equal to the periodicity of the alternating magnetizing field.,10.1190/1.1445026
Application Of Artificial Intelligence For Euler Solutions Clustering,"The clusters provide solutions associated with particular bodies, or parts of bodies, allowing the analysis of different clusters of Euler solutions separately. This may allow computation of average parameters for individual causative bodies. Those measurements of the anomalous field that yield clusters also form dense clusters themselves. Application of this clustering technique thus outlines areas where the influence of different causative sources is more prominent. This allows one to focus on these areas for more detailed study, using different window sizes, structural indices, etc.",10.1190/1.1543204
Diagnostics Of Seismic Time-Lapse Effects Of Sandstones Based On Laboratory Data,"We evaluated a viscoelastic modeling of P- and S-wave velocity dispersion, attenuation, pressure, and fluid effects for a set of siliciclastic rock samples. Our analysis used a published laboratory data set of 63 sandstones with a wide range of compositional heterogeneities. We observed a notable correlation between the (velocity and attenuation) pressure sensitivity and the abundance/lack of quartz in the samples. We included compliant pores (low-aspect ratio) proportionally to the content of secondary minerals to account for the differential sensitivity to pressure. The observed velocity and attenuation were well reproduced by the applied viscoelastic modeling. We found that pores of significantly different scale required pore fluid relaxation time constants of proportionally different magnitudes to reproduce the velocity and attenuation measurements. The relaxation time constant of crack-sized pores can be one order of magnitude smaller than the constant of mesopores. Moreover, the velocity dispersion and attenuation signatures revealed that a pore textural model dependent on lithological composition is critical in the prediction of time-lapse fluid and pressure responses.",10.1190/geo2013-0167.1
Long-Wavelength P-Wave And S-Wave Propagation In Jointed Rock Masses,"Field data suggest that stress level and joint condition affect shear-wave propagation in jointed rock masses. However, the study of long-wavelength propagation in a jointed rock mass is challenging in the laboratory, and limited data are available under controlled test conditions. Long-wavelength P-wave and S-wave propagation normal to joints, using an axially loaded jointed column device, reproduces a range of joint conditions. The effects of the normal stress, loading history, joint spacing, matched surface topography (i.e., joint roughness), joint cementation (e.g., after grouting), joint opening, and plasticity of the joint filling on the P-wave and S-wave velocities and on S-wave attenuation are notable. The ratio    VP ∕ VS    in jointed rock masses differs from that found in homogeneous continua. The concept of Poisson's ratio as a function of    VP ∕ VS    is unwarranted, and    VP ∕ VS    can be interpreted in terms of jointed characteristics. Analytic models that consider stress-dependent stiffness and frictional loss in joints as well as stress-independent properties of intact rocks can model experimental observations properly and extract joint properties from rock-mass test data. Thus, joint properties and normal stress have a prevalent role in propagation velocity and attenuation in jointed rock masses.",10.1190/1.3196240
Quantitative Seismic Analysis Of A Thin Layer Of Co2 In The Sleipner Injection Plume,"Time-lapse seismic reflection data have proved to be the key monitoring tool at the Sleipner CO2 injection project. Thin layers of CO2 in the Sleipner injection plume show striking reflectivity on the time-lapse data, but the derivation of accurate layer properties, such as thickness and velocity, remains very challenging. This is because the rock physics properties are not well-constrained nor are CO2 distributions on a small scale. However, because the reflectivity is dominantly composed of interference wavelets from thin-layer tuning, the amplitude and frequency content of the wavelets can be diagnostic of their temporal thickness. A spectral decomposition algorithm based on the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution has been developed. This enables single frequency slices to be extracted with sufficient frequency and temporal resolution to provide diagnostic spectral information on individual CO2 layers. The topmost layer of CO2 in the plume is particularly suitable for this type of analysis because it is not affected by attenuation from overlying CO2 layers and because there are areas in which it is temporally isolated from deeper layers. Initial application of the algorithm to the topmost layer shows strong evidence of thin-layer tuning effects. Analysis of tuning frequencies on high-resolution 2D data suggests that layer two-way temporal thicknesses in the range 6 to 11 ms can be derived with an accuracy of c. 2 ms. Direct measurements of reflectivity from the top and the base of the layer permit calculation of layer velocity, with values of around 1470  ms−1, in reasonable agreement with existing rock physics estimates. The frequency analysis can, therefore, provide diagnostic information on layer thicknesses in the range of 4 to 8 ms. The method is currently being extended to the full 3D time-lapse data sets at Sleipner.",10.1190/geo2011-0449.1
Uranium Exploration With Computer‐Processed Landsat Data,"A spectral signature has been constructed for an oxidized topsoil found in the vicinity of near‐surface uranium deposits in porous, arkosic sandstones of the Wind River Basin, Wyoming. A new type of contour map, created from Landsat computer compatible tapes, designed to connect regions of equal percentage of ground area covered by a specified target of interest, was applied to a Landsat frame covering the entire basin. The resulting maps showed relatively high percentages of ground cover by this particular topsoil in regions adjacent to open pit uranium mines in the Gas Hills region, as well as on or near known uranium prospects (as yet undisturbed) in the basin interior. A 10,000-pixel test area west of Lander, Wyoming was found to contain only one pixel (a 0.01 percent recognition rate) identified as the topsoil of interest. However, a whole‐frame recognition map produced a much higher (0.58 percent) recognition rate, indicating that the false alarm rate for this signature is still significantly high, although better than what can be expected from photointerpretation of single ratio images or color composite ratio images. This ""signature"" has been applied to Landsat frames in other geographical areas with known uranium mines in porous sandstone, and oxidized topsoil has been recognized near these mines.",10.1190/1.1440724
Multiscale Migration Tomography To Constrain Depth-Imaging Artifacts,"Multiscale tomography (MST) can constrain depth-imaging artifacts that appear in the velocity field inverted using conventional single-scale tomography (SST). Depth-imaging artifacts are poorly constrained velocity results that cause defocusing and/or incorrect structures in the migrated stack. The quality of an inverted velocity distribution from a tomographic approach depends heavily on ray coverage. In areas of poor ray coverage with a small ray count or parallel rays, the velocity distribution can be nonunique because of the lack of constraints. In the case of large residual moveouts from prestack migration, which most likely could happen in the presence of a complex geologic setting, serious depth-imaging artifacts can appear in the velocity field inverted using SST. To solve this problem, we tested the ability of MST to constrain artifacts in a case study. MST parameterizes the study area into overlapping submodels of different grid sizes. The inverted velocity-perturbation value for a specific location is the superposition of velocity-perturbation values from those submodels. The submodel with a large grid size provides a stable regional value that helps constrain local artifacts from submodels of smaller grid sizes. Artifacts using SST are suppressed significantly by MST. Migrated stack and common-image gathers indicated improvements in the velocity field from MST compared with the initial velocity field and that from SST.",10.1190/1.2953088
Effect Of Conductive Host Rock On Borehole Transient Electromagnetic Responses,"Transient electromagnetic (TEM) borehole responses of 3-D vertical and horizontal tabular bodies in a half‐space are calculated to assess the effect of a conductive host. The transmitter is a large loop at the surface of the earth, and the receiver measures the time derivative of the vertical magnetic field. When the host is conductive (100 Ω ⋅ m), the borehole response is due mainly to current channeled through the body. The observed magnetic‐field response can be visualized as due to galvanic currents that pass through the conductor and return in the half‐space. When the host resistivity is increased, the magnetic field of the conductor is influenced more by vortex currents that flow in closed loops inside the conductor. For a moderately resistive host (1000 Ω ⋅ m), the magnetic field of the body is caused by both vortex and galvanic currents. The galvanic response is observed at early times, followed by the vortex response at later times if the body is well coupled to the transmitter. If the host is very resistive, the galvanic response vanishes; and the response of the conductor is caused only by vortex currents. The shapes of the borehole profiles change considerably with changes in the host resistivity because vortex and galvanic current distributions are very different. When only the vortex response is observed, it is easy to distinguish vertical and horizontal conductors. However, in a conductive host where the galvanic response is dominant, it is difficult to interpret the geometry of the body; only the approximate location of the body can be determined easily. For a horizontal conductor and a single transmitting loop, only the galvanic response enables one to determine whether the conductor is between the transmitter and the borehole or beyond the borehole. A field example shows behavior similar to that of our theoretical results.",10.1190/1.1442687
"Non‐Gaussian Reflectivity, Entropy, And Deconvolution","Standard deconvolution techniques assume that the wavelet is minimum phase but generally make no assumptions about the amplitude distribution of the primary reflection coefficient sequence. For a white reflection sequence the assumption of a Gaussian distribution means that recovery of the true phase of the wavelet is impossible; however, a non‐Gaussian distribution in theory allows recovery of the phase. It is generally recognized that primary reflection coefficients typically have a non‐Gaussian amplitude distribution. Deconvolution techniques that assume whiteness but seek to exploit the non‐Gaussianity include Wiggins' minimum entropy deconvolution (MED), Claerbout's parsimonious deconvolution, and Gray's variable norm deconvolution. These methods do not assume minimum phase. The deconvolution filter is defined by the maximization of a function called the objective. I examine these and other MED‐type deconvolution techniques. Maximizing the objective by setting derivatives to zero results in most cases in a deconvolution filter which is the solution of a highly nonlinear Toeplitz matrix equation. Wiggins' original iterative approach to the solution is suitable for some methods, while for other methods straightforward iterative perturbation approaches may be used instead. The likely effects on noise of the nonlinearities involved are demonstrated as extremely varied. When the form of an objective remains constant with iteration, the most general description of the method is likelihood ratio maximization; when the form changes, a method seeks to maximize relative entropy at each iteration. I emphasize simple and useful link between three methods and the use of M-estimators in robust statistics. In attempting to assess the accuracy of the techniques, the choice between different families of distributions for modeling the distribution of reflection coefficients is important. The results provide important insights into methods of constructing and understanding the statistical implications and behavior of a chosen nonlinearity. A new objective is introduced to illustrate this, and a few particular preferences expressed. The methods are compared with the zero‐memory nonlinear deconvolution approach of Godfrey and Rocca (1981); for their approach, two distinctly different yet statistically comparable models for reflection coefficients are seen to give surprisingly similarly shaped nonlinearities. Finally, it is shown that each MED‐type method can be viewed as the minimization of a particular configurational entropy expression, where some suitable ratio plays the role of a probability.",10.1190/1.1441905
Computer Ray Tracing Through Complex Geological Models For Ground Motion Studies,"A computer program has been developed to study the effect of subsurface geology on the propagation of seismic body waves. The program, which is based on ray theory and on numerical solution of Zoeppritz's equations for any angle of incidence at elastic boundaries, traces seismic rays and energy distribution through geological models of any complexity. The geological models are composed of rock units that are assumed to be isotropic, perfectly elastic, and homogeneous, and are two‐dimensional in distribution. The ray tracing program was applied to two geologic models of the crust, that are more than 100 miles long, starting at drill hole UE20F in the Nevada Test Site. The results, displayed as raypath plots and plots of the amplitude of vertical displacement at the earth's surface, graphically illustrate the strong influence of the spatial distribution and elastic property variations of rock units in raypath distribution.",10.1190/1.1440117
Reflection Shear‐Wave Data Collected Near The Principal Axes Of Azimuthal Anisotropy,"The presence of vertically oriented fractures and/or unequal horizontal stresses has created an azimuthally anisotropic earth, in which shear‐wave (SH) data collected along the principal axes of the anisotropy display time and reflection amplitude anomalies. Amoco shot two crossing shear‐wave (SH) lines that were approximately parallel to the orthogonal principal axes of the azimuthal anisotropy. At the tie point, these crossing SH lines display a time‐variant mis‐tie. The tie point also displays reflection‐coefficient anomalies, attributable to azimuthally dependent shear‐wave velocities. Field mapping documented a set of fractures striking N69E which are approximately parallel to the line that exhibited greater traveltimes. Time‐variant mis‐ties and reflection coefficient anomalies are two of the seismic responses theoretically expected of an azimuthally anisotropic earth, i.e., one in which the shear‐wave velocity depends upon the polarization azimuth of the shear wave.",10.1190/1.1442821

Gaussian Envelope For 3D Geomagnetic Data Inversion,"We assume that there is no remanent magnetization and that the magnetic data are produced by induced magnetization only, neglecting any demagnetization effects. The algorithm proceeds by minimization of a χ2 misfit function between real and predicted data using a nonlinear Levenberg‐Marquardt iteration scheme, easily implemented on a desktop PC, without any additional regularization. We demonstrate the robustness and utility of the method using synthetic data corrupted by pseudorandom generated noise and a real field data set.",10.1190/1.1581071
Radioactivity Logging And Its Future Potential,"The quantitative application of radioactivity logs for the estimation of formation petrophysical properties is dependent on certain fundamental factors which are discussed. It is difficult to avoid ""hybrid"" combinations of processes; for example neutron‐neutron and neutron‐gamma effects together, however, it is believed that the future of quantitative application of neutron logs depends to a large extent on the development of single component logging processes. Positive location of the sonde within the borehole for all types of logs needs further development. These improvements plus future developments in gamma‐ray spectral logs, neutron‐gamma spectral logs, neutron activation logs, and neutron inelastic scattering logs promise a bright future for radioactivity logging.",10.1190/1.1438767
Three‐Dimensional Regularized Focusing Inversion Of Gravity Gradient Tensor Component Data,"We develop a new method for interpretation of tensor gravity field component data, based on regularized focusing inversion. The focusing inversion makes its possible to reconstruct a sharper image of the geological target than conventional maximum smoothness inversion. This new technique can be efficiently applied for the interpretation of gravity gradiometer data, which are sensitive to local density anomalies. The numerical modeling and inversion results show that the resolution of the gravity method can be improved significantly if we use tensor gravity data for interpretation. We also apply our method for inversion of the gradient gravity data collected by BHP Billiton over the Cannington Ag‐Pb‐Zn orebody in Queensland, Australia. The comparison with the drilling results demonstrates a remarkable correlation between the density anomaly reconstructed by the gravity gradient data and the true structure of the orebody. This result indicates that the emerging new geophysical technology of the airborne gravity gradient observations can improve significantly the practical effectiveness of the gravity method in mineral exploration.",10.1190/1.1778236
A Proposed Polarity Standard For Multicomponent Seismic Data,"We distinguish among three kinds of polarity standard: acquisition, preprocessing, and final‐display standards. The acquisition standard (summarized in the preceding paragraph) relates instrument output solely to sense of ground motion (geophones) and of pressure change (hydrophones). Polarity considerations beyond this [involving, e.g., source type, wave type (P or S), direction of arrival, anisotropy, tap‐test adjustments, etc.] fall under preprocessing polarity standards. We largely defer any consideration of a display standard.",10.1190/1.1500363
In‐Situ Induced‐Polarization And Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements—Yerington Mine,"The Yerington Mine is an open pit mine of ""porphyry‐copper"" type. Primary mineralization (quartz veins, Cu‐Fe sulfides, magnetite, and silicate alteration) is closely associated with a complex sequence of quartz monzonite porphyry intrusives. This primary mineralization is disrupted by subsequent alteration and faulting. The fault block containing the deposit has been rotated almost 90 degrees to the west; plan maps represent pretilt vertical sections. Almost one mile of pretilt vertical extent is exposed in the pit. Geologic observations may be taken only upon mining advances at discrete intervals. Detailed in‐situ induced‐polarization response and magnetic susceptibility surveys, both taken upon the pit floor, have been used to supplement geologic mapping. These in‐situ measurements reveal the distribution patterns of sulfides and magnetite and are useful in interpolation or correlation of contacts, faults, and mineralization patterns between mapped advances. In‐situ induced‐polarization (IP) response was measured using a Scintrex IPR-7 receiver. Observations were made on a 10 × 10-ft grid using a Wenner electrode array with 3 1/3-ft a‐spacing. Susceptibility measurements were taken with a Bison model 3101-A bridge and an in‐situ coil arrangement 5 ft in diameter. A composite area approximately 3000 by 500 ft, representing 15,000 data points, has been surveyed. Contoured maps of in‐situ IP response and magnetic susceptibility reveal the mineralization pattern in detail. These maps correlate well with the geologically mapped distribution of porphyry intrusives and also indicate zones of sulfide remobilization and/or magnetite destruction, including fault zones. IP response and magnetic susceptibility correlate well with elemental assays, mineral abundances, ratios, and textures determined from bench mapping and pit floor samples. The spatial distribution of physical properties is extremely complex, which demonstrates the need for caution in the use of simple interpretative models. The abundance of magnetite locally present in this particular porphyry‐copper environment is noteworthy.",10.1190/1.1441015
Least-Squares Migration In The Presence Of Velocity Errors,"Seismic migration requires an accurate background velocity model that correctly predicts the kinematics of wave propagation in the true subsurface. Least-squares migration, which seeks the inverse rather than the adjoint of a forward modeling operator, is especially sensitive to errors in this background model. This can result in traveltime differences between predicted and observed data that lead to incoherent and defocused migration images. We have developed an alternative misfit function for use in least-squares migration that measures amplitude differences between predicted and observed data, i.e., differences after correcting for nonzero traveltime shifts between predicted and observed data. We demonstrated on synthetic and field data that, when the background velocity model is incorrect, the use of this misfit function results in better focused migration images. Results suggest that our method best enhances image focusing when differences between predicted and observed data can be explained by traveltime shifts.",10.1190/geo2013-0374.1
Suppression Of The Acquisition Footprint For Seismic Sequence Attribute Mapping,"Seismic coherency has proven to be very effective in delineating geologic faults as well as considerably more subtle stratigraphic features, including channels, canyons, slumps, levees, glacial gouges, dewatering patterns and pinnacle reefs. Unfortunately, seismic coherency estimates, which quantitatively measure the similarity or dissimilarity of adjacent traces in 3-D, are particularly sensitive to coherent noise that passes through the acquisition and processing flow. They are also sensitive to dissimilarities in fold, offset, and azimuth distribution introduced through the 3-D acquisition and binning processes. Edge enhancement algorithms further exacerbate these linear artifacts. We define the acquisition footprint to be any pattern of noise that is highly correlated to the geometric distribution of sources and receivers on the earth's surface. While the strong acquisition footprints such as those caused by normal moveout (NMO) stretch on vintage single‐fold data have been largely ameliorated by modern 2-D multifold recording, we see acquisition 3-D footprint in the low‐fold shallow section and throughout the entire section when recording sparse 3-D land surveys that often result in only six- to sevenfold data. One may partially suppress the acquisition footprint on the seismic coherency time or depth slices using conventional 2-D image processing. Unfortunately, such filtering is inappropriate for dip/azimuth maps, cluster analysis maps, and other maps that may not be continuous real variables or with maps that have cyclic values, such as the wavelet phase. We show that simple 3-D true‐amplitude dip filtering of the input 3-D (t, x, y) time- or depth‐migrated seismic data volume can be quite effective in minimizing the detrimental effect of the acquisition footprint on conventional 3-D seismic attributes for both marine and land data acquisition geometries. However, 3-D dip filtering of migrated data will often eliminate the fault‐plane reflections necessary for sharp coherency images. We therefore recommend that, whenever possible, suppression of acquisition footprint be performed before 3-D migration on the stacked data volume, where sharp fault truncations in depth are represented by smoothly varying diffractions in time.",10.1190/1.1444380
"Geophysical Study Of Cenozoic Geologic Structures Of Northern Owens Valley, California","A narrow gravity minimum anomaly of amplitude 30 mgals indicates that northern Owens Valley, California, a narrow fault‐bounded trough or graben filled with Cenozoic clastic deposits to a depth of as much as 8,000 ft. Seismic‐refraction measurements support this conclusion. Aeromagnetic and gravity measurements define a small, dense, and magnetic body buried by the valley fill of northern Owens Valley.",10.1190/1.1439021
Seismic Attenuation Spectra In Rock Mass Characterization; A Case Study In Open‐Pit Mining,"The application of engineering geophysics to the characterization of rock masses is exemplified through a case study of three phases of a research project into the design of efficient blasting systems in open‐pit mining. Seismic experiments are used before and after mine blasting to monitor the efficiency of explosions in terms of rock fragmentation. Spectral analysis of seismic signals, after they have been used to interrogate rock masses, is used to compute preblast and postblast attenuation and velocity parameters. The results show that fragmentation efficiency of a mine blast and fracture anisotropy of a rock mass can be quantified in terms of three‐dimensional (3-D) attenuation spectra and polar anisotropy diagrams. These seismic data are correlated with the blast design and the energy used by the excavating dragline machine to dig to rock mass. An overview of the seismic attenuation technique and instrumentation used in the project (phases I and II) is given. A case study from phase III highlights the scope and interpretation of the relationship between excavation parameters and seismically characterized blasting efficiency.",10.1190/1.1442090
Traveltime Computation In Transversely Isotropic Media,"An approach for calculating first‐arrival traveltimes in a transversely isotropic medium is developed and has the advantage of avoiding shadow zones while still being computationally fast. Also, it works with an arbitrary velocity grid that may have discontinuities. The method is based on Fermat's principle. The traveltime for each point in the grid is calculated several times using previously calculated traveltimes at surrounding grid points until the minimum time is found. Different ranges of propagation angle are covered in each traveltime calculation such that at the end of the process all propagation angles are covered. This guarantees that the  first‐arrival traveltime for a specific grid point is correctly calculated. The resulting algorithm is fully vectorizable. The method is robust and can accurately determine first‐arrival traveltimes in heterogeneous media. Traveltimes are compared to finite‐difference modeling of transversely isotropic media and are found to be in excellent agreement. An application to prestack migration is used to illustrate the usefulness of the method.",10.1190/1.1443589
Hydrophone Vsp Imaging At A Shallow Site,"We evaluated the capabilities of vertical seismic profiling (VSP) for imaging the complex heterogeneous unconsolidated sedimentary structures at a shallow site. We deployed a 24‐level hydrophone array with 0.5-m level spacing down a preexisting poly vinyl chloride (PVC) cased well. Data acquisition time was quick. Only 15 multioffset shot points using a hammer‐on‐plate source were needed to acquire reflection data between the water table at 3 m and the bedrock at 35 m to produce a depth section image. This image extended 9 m from the receiver well, yielding resolutions between fresh‐water‐bearing sands and impermeable muds and clays of better than 1 m. Depth accuracy of the image was confirmed by good correlation with cone penetrometer logs. We used conventional wavefield separation and VSP-CDP mapping techniques to image the data. Tube waves, created by seismic arrivals at cross‐sectional area changes in the borehole fluid column, were the primary source of coherent noise in the data. The tube‐wave arrival structure was complicated by the hydrophone array, which generated and scattered tube waves at each hydrophone pod. To combat the tube wave interference, we inserted closed‐cell‐foam baffles between elements. The baffles attenuated and slowed the tube waves, and reduced generation and scattering. A comparison between unbaffled and baffled VSP data showed that baffling increased the maximum useful frequency from 300 Hz to over 900 Hz. By contrast, surface shot data recorded at the same site, using buried 40-Hz vertical geophones, exhibited useful frequencies of less than 250 Hz. In addition, coherent noise in surface shot records caused by air waves and first arrivals made it very difficult to identify shallow reflections above 25 m. Reflections from depths as shallow as 10 m were easy to identify in the baffled VSP data.",10.1190/1.1444193
Seismoelectric Imaging Of Shallow Targets,"We have undertaken a series of controlled field experiments to develop seismoelectric experimental methods for near-surface applications and to improve our understanding of seismoelectric phenomena. In a set of off-line geometry surveys (source separated from the receiver line), we place seismic sources and electrode array receivers on opposite sides of a man-made target (two sand-filled trenches) to record separately two previously documented seismoelectric modes: (1) the electromagnetic interface response signal created at the target and (2) the coseismic electric fields located within a compressional seismic wave. With the seismic source point in the center of a linear electrode array, we identify the previously undocumented seismoelectric direct field, and the Lorentz field of the metal hammer plate moving in the earth's magnetic field. We place the seismic source in the center of a circular array of electrodes (radial and circumferential orientations) to analyze the source-related direct and Lorentz fields and to establish that these fields can be understood in terms of simple analytical models. Using an off-line geometry, we create a multifold, 2D image of our trenches as dipping layers, and we also produce a complementary synthetic image through numerical modeling. These images demonstrate that off-line geometry (e.g., crosswell) surveys offer a particularly promising application of the seismoelectric method because they effectively separate the interface response signal from the (generally much stronger) coseismic and source-related fields.",10.1190/1.2428267
Magnetic Anomalies Of Two‐Dimensional Bodies In A Magnetic Half‐Space,"The presence of magnetization in country rock modifies the anomaly caused by magnetic bodies. Such a modification is distinct from the self‐demagnetization effect of the body, and the concept of susceptibility contrast is not adequate to explain it. We can achieve an exact understanding of the problem by solving the potential function in three media: air, magnetic country rock, and magnetized body. This paper sets up the solution of this problem when the magnetized body is a circular cylinder with an infinitely long horizontal axis, for both a horizontal and a vertical inducing ambient field. It expresses the solution of Laplace's equation in bipolar coordinates for the potentials in the form of Fourier series. Analysis of the vertical, horizontal, and total magnetic anomalies shows that neglect of country rock magnetization reduces the apparent causative body dimensions.",10.1190/1.1441385
Acoustic Relaxation In Sedimentary Rocks: Dependence On Grain Contacts And Fluid Saturation,Partial fluid saturation affects absorption and dispersion in sandstones. The proposed theoretical model describes acoustic relaxation due to local fluid flow. Previously proposed models of local flow were based on microgeometries not representative of sedimentary rocks; they were unable to describe the behavior of partially saturated sandstones. The new model is based upon observed microstructures in sandstones. A fraction of the grain contacts in sandstones are permeated by sheet‐like gaps. The incomplete solid‐solid contact allows an interconnected fluid film to exist between the grain surfaces. The model consists of a narrow gap connected to a finite annular pore. An acoustic stress wave drives the film out of the narrow contact region and into the adjacent pore. The viscous flow results in a dissipation of energy. The model predicts the real and imaginary parts of the complex frame moduli as a function of frequency and fluid saturation. The predictions agree well with experimental results.,10.1190/1.1442128
Efficient Angle-Domain Common-Image Gathers Using Cauchy-Condition-Based Polarization Vectors,"Because angle-domain common-image gathers (ADCIGs) from reverse time migration (RTM) are capable of obtaining the correct illumination of a subsurface geologic structure, they provide more reliable information for velocity model building, amplitude-variation versus angle analysis, and attribute interpretation. The approaches for generating ADCIGs mainly consist of two types: (1) indirect approaches that convert extended image gathers into ADCIGs and (2) direct approaches that first obtain propagating angles of wavefronts and then map the imaging result to the angle domain. In practice, however, generation of ADCIGs usually incurs high computational cost, poor resolution, and other drawbacks. To generate efficient ADCIGs using RTM methods, we have introduced a novel approach to obtain polarization vectors — directions of particle motion — from the Cauchy wavefield (CWF) and an efficient localized plane-wave decomposition algorithm to implement the angle-domain imaging condition. The CWF is a wavefield constructed from the Cauchy condition of the wave equation at any given time, and it only contains negative frequencies of the original wavefield so that the polarization vector is obtained from the local CWF in the wavenumber domain. With polarization vectors at our disposal, we have further developed an efficient localized plane-wave decomposition algorithm to implement the angle-domain imaging condition. Numerical examples have indicated that the new approach is able to handle complex wave phenomenon and has advantages in illuminating subsurface structure.",10.1190/geo2015-0327.1

Resistivity Mapping With An Airborne Multicoil Electromagnetic System,"Dighem is a helicopter‐borne 900 Hz multicoil electromagnetic survey system. The EM device consists of a 30-ft towed bird containing a transmitter coil in the front and three mutually orthogonal receiver coils in the rear. Resistivity contour maps can be prepared from the EM data using any of several half‐space models. In this paper, two such models are selected and field examples of apparent resistivity derived from them are shown. The multicoil system has encountered areas of widespread conductivity while surveying for metallic minerals. In such areas, EM anomalies can be generated by changes of less than 10 m in survey altitude. EM anomalies of apparent significance, therefore, can reflect decreases in survey altitude as well as increases in conductivity of the earth. Under such conditions, apparent resistivity contour maps can aid the interpretation of the airborne data. The advantage of the contour maps is that anomalies caused by altitude changes are substantially reduced, and the contours reflect mainly the conductive anomalies. Resistivity contour maps improve the interpreter's ability to differentiate between conductive trends in the bedrock and those patterns typical of conductive overburden. Airborne resistivity mapping can be applied to a number of engineering problems. The multicoil system has been used for permafrost delineation and gravel detection. To be useful, the geologic units being mapped should have a resistivity less than 1000 Ω-m (for the 900 Hz frequency) and a surface extent of several acres.",10.1190/1.1440817
The Poulter Seismic Method Of Geophysical Exploration,The Poulter seismic method is outlined and an analysis is made of the frequency distribution of seismic energy from different sources. The effect of different sources upon the directivity of the energy in the ground and the improvement that can be obtained in signal‐to‐noise ratio is discussed. Three different methods are described for controlling the frequency of the seismic impulses being introduced into the ground and the resulting improvement in the quality of records is illustrated. The almost complete elimination of multiple reflections by the method is indicated.,10.1190/1.1437589
Use Of Wavefront Curvature To Relate Seismic Data With Subsurface Parameters,"A Dix‐type formula relating the normal moveout velocity (VNMO) to the parameters of a two‐dimensional, dipping bed, multilayered model of the earth is discussed. The formula results from (1) showing that the VNMO is related to the radius of curvature of the wavefront emerging at the surface after reflection from some interior horizon, and (2) expressing this radius in terms of the parameters of the earth model. An example with severely dipping layers is used to compute the VNMO from the formula, which is then compared to the value of moveout velocity obtained from a synthetic velocity gather generated at the same point in the model.",10.1190/1.1440377
Variation Of P-Wave Reflectivity With Offset And Azimuth In Anisotropic Media,"P-wave amplitudes may be sensitive even to relatively weak anisotropy of rock mass. Recent results on symmetry‐plane P-wave reflection coefficients in azimuthally anisotropic media are extended to observations at arbitrary azimuth, large incidence angles, and lower symmetry systems. The approximate P-wave reflection coefficient in transversely isotropic media with a horizontal axis of symmetry (HTI) (typical for a system of parallel vertical cracks embedded in an isotropic matrix) shows that the amplitude versus offset (AVO) gradient varies as a function of the squared cosine of the azimuthal angle. This change can be inverted for the symmetry‐plane directions and a combination of the shear‐wave splitting parameter γ and the anisotropy coefficient δ(V). The reflection coefficient study is also extended to media of orthorhombic symmetry that are believed to be more realistic models of fractured reservoirs. The study shows the orthorhombic and HTI reflection coefficients are very similar and the azimuthal variation in the orthorhombic P-wave reflection response is a function of the shear‐wave splitting parameter γ and two anisotropy parameters describing P-wave anisotropy for near‐vertical propagation in the symmetry planes. The simple relationships between the reflection amplitudes and anisotropic coefficients given here can be regarded as helpful rules of thumb in quickly evaluating the importance of anisotropy in a particular play, integrating results of NMO and shear‐wave‐splitting analyses, planning data acquisition, and guiding more advanced numerical amplitude‐inversion procedures.",10.1190/1.1444405
An Iterative Approach To Seismic Skeletonization,"In this paper pattern recognition techniques are applied to the automatic tracking of seismic reflectors. We call this procedure seismic skeletonization, since it reduces a seismic section into a line drawing corresponding to seismic reflectors. The procedure uses an iterative approach. Strong reflectors are tracked first; weaker reflectors are tracked at later iterations. At any iteration, the tracking is confined to the areas delineated by the reflectors already tracked in a previous iteration. Reflectors are tracked by correlating neighboring seismic traces. An algorithm called the binary consistency‐checking (BCC) scheme is used to correlate three traces at a time. The combined use of the iterative approach and the BCC scheme is efficient, emulating human interpretation and incorporating ""geologic trend"" into the results.",10.1190/1.1442778
"Subsalt Imaging For Exploration, Production, And Development: A Review","The field of subsalt imaging has evolved rapidly in the last decade, thanks in part to the availability of low cost massive computing infrastructure, and also to the development of new seismic acquisition techniques that try to mitigate the problems caused by the presence of salt. This paper serves as an introduction to the special Geophysics section on Subsalt Imaging for EP. The purpose of the special section is to bring together practitioners of subsalt imaging in the wider sense, i.e., not only algorithm developers, but also the interpretation community that utilizes the latest technology to carry out subsalt exploration and development. The purpose of the paper is in many ways pedagogical and historical. We address the question of what subsalt imaging is and discuss the physics of the subsalt imaging problem, especially the illumination issue. After a discussion of the problem, we then give a review of the main algorithms that have been developed and implemented within the last decade, namely Kirchhoff and Beam imaging, one-way wavefield extrapolation methods and the full two-way reverse time migration. This review is not meant to be exhaustive, and is qualitative to make it accessible to a wide audience. For each method and algorithm we highlight the benefits and the weaknesses. We then address the imaging conditions that are a fundamental part of each imaging algorithm. While we dive into more technical detail, the section should still be accessible to a wide audience. Gathers of various sorts are introduced and their usage explained. Model building and velocity update strategies and tools are presented next. Finally, the last section shows a few results from specific algorithms. The latest techniques such as waveform inversion or the ""dirty salt"" techniques will not be covered, as they will be elaborated upon by other authors in the special section. With the massive effort that the industry has devoted to this field, much remains to be done to give interpreters the accurate detailed images of the subsurface that are needed. In that sense the salt is still winning, although the next decade will most likely change this situation.",10.1190/geo2011-0156.1
Geophysical Surveys Of Burial Sites: A Case Study Of The Oaro Urupa,"A Maori family burial site was surveyed using shallow electromagnetic (EM), magnetometer/gradiometer, and ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) techniques. The locations of some older graves are no longer known, partly through the loss of markers and partly through the loss of the oral record. There are at least 150 such burial sites throughout New Zealand, and similar problems occur elsewhere in the world. The knowledge that Maori graves are traditionally set out facing east made survey design easier. Background trends are removed, and possible anomalous features are identified, despite the complicating presence of metal fencing. The EM in‐phase response, the vertical gradient of the total magnetic field, and the GPR response were particularly useful in combination. GPR surveys were carried out using two frequencies: 450 and 200 MHz. The higher frequency radar surveys were limited in extent because these data had a limited depth of penetration and were prone to signal ""ringing"" in the surficial clay. The lower frequency radar surveys were also troubled by ringing. Nonetheless, anomalous features, especially diffractions, can be recognised. The radar anomalies were enhanced by removal of an average background response. The comparison and correlation of the individual data sets are used to estimate the positions of unmarked graves, using marked graves for calibration. Some interpreted positions of graves are at first surprising, but their locations are consistent with elements of the oral history of the site.",10.1190/1.1444540
Inferring The Statistical Distribution Of Velocity Heterogeneities By Statistical Traveltime Tomography,"Understanding the internal heterogeneities of reservoirs is one of the key issues in better recovery and efficient reservoir management. Seismic data are widely used to map subsurface heterogeneities. These heterogeneities can include variations in wave velocity and rock density, which can be used to interpret variations in reservoir properties such as porosity, lithofacies, and fluids. This paper describes a statistical tomography method to infer the spatial statistics of subsurface velocity heterogeneities from seismic data. We consider an acoustic wave propagating in a medium represented as a single macromodel superimposed on statistically stationary random velocity perturbations. While the macromodel is retrieved by classical seismic methods, the picked traveltimes and their fluctuations are used to estimate the covariance function of the spatially varying velocity perturbations. We present a formulation based on ray‐theoretical results and describe two algorithms: one using the prestack traveltimes and the other using the stacking velocities. The methods are tested with synthetic seismic reflection data in an idealized medium (with a Gaussian spatial covariance) and with synthetic transmission data in a more geologically realistic medium. Then, the two algorithms are applied on real data. The estimates of the spatial statistics obtained from inverting the traveltime statistics match reasonably well with the true parameters of the heterogeneous media.",10.1190/1.1620645
Synthetic Reflection Seismograms In Three Dimensions By A Locked‐Mode Approximation,"We present a simple algorithm for computing the acoustic response of a layered structure containing three‐dimensional (3-D) irregularities, using a locked‐mode approach and the Born approximation. The effects of anelasticity are incorporated by use of Rayleigh's principle. The method is particularly attractive at somewhat larger offsets, but computations for near‐source offsets are stable as well, due to the introduction of anelastic damping. Calculations can be done on small minicomputers. The algorithm developed in this paper can be used to calculate the response of complicated models in three dimensions. It is more efficient than any other method whenever many sources are involved. The results are useful for modeling, as well as for generating test signals for data processing with realistic, model‐induced ""noise."" Also, this approach provides an alternative to 2-D finite‐difference calculations that is efficient enough for application to large‐scale inverse problems. The method is illustrated by application to a simple 3-D structure in a layered medium.",10.1190/1.1442660
Fracture Characterization At Valhall: Application Of P‐Wave Amplitude Variation With Offset And Azimuth (Avoa) Analysis To A 3D Ocean‐Bottom Data Set,"The delineation and characterization of fracturing is important in the successful exploitation of many hydrocarbon reservoirs. Such fracturing often occurs in preferentially aligned sets; if the fractures are of subseismic scale, this may result in seismic anisotropy. Thus, measurements of anisotropy from seismic data may be used to delineate fracture patterns and investigate their properties. Here fracture‐induced anisotropy is investigated in the Valhall field, which lies in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. This field is a chalk reservoir with good porosity but variable permeability, where fractures may significantly impact production, e.g., during waterflooding. To investigate the nature of fracturing in this reservoir, P‐wave amplitude variation with offset and azimuth (AVOA) is analyzed in a 3D ocean‐bottom cable (OBC) data set. In general, 3D ocean‐bottom seismic (OBS) acquisition leads to patchy coverage in offset and azimuth, and this must be addressed when considering such data. To overcome this challenge and others associated with 3D OBS acquisition, a new method for processing and analysis is presented. For example, a surface fitting approach, which involves analyzing azimuthal variations in AVO gradients, is used to estimate the orientation and magnitude of the fracture‐induced anisotropy. This approach is also more widely applicable to offset‐azimuth analysis of other attributes (e.g., traveltimes) and any data set where there has been true 3D data acquisition, land or marine. Using this new methodology, we derive high‐resolution maps of P‐wave anisotropy from the AVOA analysis for the top‐chalk reflection at Valhall. These anisotropy maps show coherent but laterally varying trends. Synthetic AVOA modeling, using effective medium models, indicates that if this anisotropy is from aligned fracturing, the fractures are likely liquid filled with small aspect ratios and the fracture density must be high. Furthermore, we show that the fracture‐normal direction is parallel to the direction of most positive AVO gradient. In other situations the reverse can be true, i.e., the fracture‐normal direction can be parallel to the direction of the most negative AVO gradient. Effective medium modeling or comparisons with anisotropy estimates from other approaches (e.g., azimuthal variations in velocity) must therefore be used to resolve this ambiguity. The inferred fracture orientations and anisotropy magnitudes show a degree of correlation with the positions and alignments of larger scale faults, which are estimated from 3D coherency analysis. Overall, this work demonstrates that significant insight may be gained into the alignment and character of fracturing and the stress field variations throughout a field using this high‐resolution AVOA method.",10.1190/1.1598107
Physical Wavelet Frame Denoising,"This paper deals with the design and implementation of a new wavelet frame for noise suppression based on the character of seismic data. In general, wavelet denoising methods widely used in image and acoustic processing use well‐known conventional wavelets which, although versatile, are often not optimal for seismic data. The new approach, physical wavelet frame denoising uses a wavelet frame that takes into account the characteristics of seismic data both in time and space. Synthetic and real data tests show that the approach is effective even for seismic signals contaminated by strong noise which may be random or coherent, such as ground roll or air waves.",10.1190/1.1543209
Synthetic Full Waveform Acoustic Logs In Cased Boreholes,"A general expression is derived for the dispersion relations and the impulse response of a radially layered borehole. The model geometry consists of a central fluid cylinder surrounded by an arbitrary number of solid annuli. A Thomson‐Haskell type propagator matrix is used to relate stresses and displacements across the layers. Although the model is completely general, the geometries considered here are restricted to those of a cased hole. Layers of steel, cement, and formation surround the innermost fluid layer. Synthetic microseismograms containing all body and interface waves are calculated for a variety of model parameters. Formation body wave arrivals are relatively unaffected by the presence of a casing. They may, however, be hard to identify cement velocities are close to or larger than those of the formation. The Stoneley and pseudo‐Rayleigh wave arrivals are strongly influenced by the casing parameters. They respond to the combined effects of the steel, the cement, and the formation.",10.1190/1.1441720
Denoising Multicomponent Csem Data With Equivalent Source Processing Techniques,"Frequency-domain controlled-source electromagnetic surveys can be negatively affected by near-surface geologic features, resulting in static shifts in the observed electric field amplitude data. We propose using an equivalent source method to denoise electric field data from frequency-domain controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveys. The equivalent source method can either be applied individually to data from each measured frequency or simultaneously to data from all frequencies measured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by denoising an individual synthetic CSEM survey with data contaminated with noise from near-surface conductive bodies, as well as a synthetic time-lapse survey representing resistivity changes in a target due to, for instance, CO2 sequestration. We also apply the equivalent source method to denoise a set of controlled-source audio-magnetotelluric data affected by static shift from a field survey in western China.",10.1190/geo2012-0226.1
Phase Offset Indicator (Poi): A Study Of Phase Shift Versus Offset And Fluid Content,"There is limited published experimental and theoretical work related to offset‐dependent reflection and phase changes at the interface between porous media. An appropriate relationship between seismic parameters and phase shift has not been well‐established. This investigation measures variations of phase for nonnormal incidence reflection as a function of frequency at the interface of a horizontally layered porous (perforated) medium, using a two‐dimensional Plexiglas model. In both parts of this study, phase‐matched filters (PMF) are used to analyze the data. Phase‐matched filters previously have been applied to digital records of Rayleigh waves and Love waves. The purpose of the first part of the study is to demonstrate application of the PMF process to reflected compressional waves and to use this technique in discriminating multiples from primaries. By using this linear process, the complex spectrum of the primary signal can be recovered from the multiple arrivals. The reduction of reflected compressional pulse wavelets to a zero‐phase wavelet provided a tool to examine the change in phase (and amplitude) as the wave travels through a lossy medium. The second part of the study deals with the relationship of phase shift Δϕ at an interface of a horizontally layered porous medium, as a function of fluid content, angle of incidence (offset), and frequency. The result indicates that, at midband frequency of 60 kHz, an air‐ (gas‐) saturated medium would cause a large increase in Δϕ with offset, whereas a water‐saturated medium would show less change in Δϕ with offset. The phase shift‐versus‐offset response for oil is assumed to be intermediate between the responses for gas and water.",10.1190/1.1442121
"The Analytic Wavelet Transform With Generalized Morse Wavelets To Detect Fluvial Channels In The Bohai Bay Basin, China","The Middle Miocene Minghuazhen Formation of the Bohai Bay Basin is dominated by fluvial channels and shallow-lacustrine deltaic systems. These depositional facies, along with complex postdepositional faulting, make it difficult to detect fluvial channels. As a useful seismic attribute to solve this problem in the Bohai Bay Basin, spectral decomposition of 3D seismic data can provide significant information to understand the subsurface fluvial channels. The analytic wavelet transform (AWT) is a promising approach for implementing spectral decomposition to provide a detailed time-frequency representation. In particular, by varying two parameters (beta and gamma) controlling the wavelet forms, the generalized Morse wavelets (GMWs) can be given a broad range of characteristics while remaining exactly analytic. To detect fluvial channels with thickness around and lower than the tuning thickness, we have proposed a suitable (beta = 1 and gamma = 3) pair of parameters for GMWs because such an exactly analytic Morse wavelet substantially outperforms the approximately analytic Morlet wavelet for high time localization. We have applied the AWT with a GMW (beta = 1 and gamma = 3) to 3D seismic data in the Lower Minghuazhen Formation, Bohai Bay Basin, China. The stratal slicing of spectral decomposition volumes at depositional cycle 2 of the Lower Minghuazhen Formation shows its potential for channel interpretation and the optimization of well patterns.",10.1190/geo2015-0396.1
A New Misfit Function For Multimodal Inversion Of Surface Waves,"Higher-mode contribution is important in surface-wave inversion because it allows more information to be exploited, increases investigation depth, and improves model resolution. A new misfit function for multimodal inversion of surface waves, based on the Haskell-Thomson matrix method, allows higher modes to be taken into account without the need to associate experimental data points to a specific mode, thus avoiding mode-misidentification errors in the retrieved velocity profiles. Computing cost is reduced by avoiding the need for calculating synthetic apparent or modal dispersion curves. Based on several synthetic and real examples with inversion results from the classical and the proposed methods, we find that correct velocity models can be retrieved through the multimodal inversion when higher modes are superimposed in the apparent dispersion-curve or when it is not trivial to determine a priori to which mode each data point of the experimental dispersion curve belongs. The main drawback of the method is related to the presence of several local minima in the misfit function. This feature makes the choice of a consistent initial model very important.",10.1190/1.3436539
Laser-Scan And Gravity Joint Investigation For Subsurface Cavity Exploration — The Grotta Gigante Benchmark,"We have studied a big karstic cave (Grotta Gigante) in northern Italy using an innovative combination of laser-scan and gravity data. We aimed to forward model the gravity anomaly due to the cavity, verify its compatibility with the Bouguer field, and identify the eventual presence of other sources of gravity anomalies. A sensitivity study was performed preliminarily to assess the minimum size of bodies that could be detected by the gravity surveys. The 3D density model of the Grotta Gigante was constructed using as a geometric constraint the laser-scan data set, which mapped the internal morphologies of the cave, and density measurements on collected rock samples. The laser point cloud was reduced in data density, filtered from the outliers, and subdivided into two surfaces representing the vault and the floor of the cave, to correctly define the prism model. Then, a mean density value, obtained from laboratory measurements, was assigned to the prisms. We computed the gravity effect of the model in the same points at which the gravity field had been measured. Excellent correlation was found for the cavity; some gravity anomalies were revealed in the surrounding area of the Grotta Gigante that could be effected by other underground karstic morphologies. We attempted to estimate the probable size and depth of the causative bodies, compatible with the geologic environment. This site testified to the goodness of gravity methods for the exploration of such structures, that is, particularly important for risk assessment in a karstic area. The cave itself, the biggest tourist cave worldwide, represents an upper limit for expected gravity signals. The combination of exact knowledge of the causative body and the related gravity anomalies composed a unique data set (that we released to the public, as a benchmark), useful for testing inversion and forward model gravity algorithms.",10.1190/geo2014-0601.1
Electromagnetic Methods For Mapping Shallow Permafrost,"Two electromagnetic techniques, radiohm and magnetic induction, were evaluated for their ability to delineate and measure the thickness of shallow permafrost. Radiohm instruments in the VLF (15–30 kHz) and LF (200–400 kHz) band, and a magnetic induction instrument using horizontal coplanar coils, separated by a distance of 3.66 m and operating at a frequency of 39.2 kHz, were tested. Along test sites in the Mackenzie Valley, N.W.T. and in northern Alberta, boreholes were placed to verify the interpretation of the geophysical data. The results showed that both LF and the magnetic induction instrument accurately delineated permafrost. The effective depth of exploration of VLF radiation was, in general, too large for delineating boundaries of shallow permafrost. The resistivity layering over permafrost in the winter could be represented by a two‐layer model for computing the thickness of frozen ground.",10.1190/1.1440853
Fresnel Volume Migration Of Multicomponent Data,"If the aperture of a seismic reflection experiment is strongly limited, Kirchhoff migration suffers from strong artifacts attributable to incomplete summation. This can be overcome by restricting the migration operator to the region that physically contributes to a reflection event. Examples of such limited-aperture experiments include data acquisition in boreholes, tunnels, and mines. We present an extension to three-component (3C) Kirchhoff prestack depth migration, where the migration operator is restricted to the Fresnel volume of the specular reflected raypath. We use the measured polarization direction at a 3C receiver to determine points of specular reflection. In homogeneous media, the polarization angle of 3C data can be used directly to decide whether a certain image point belongs to the Fresnel volume of a specular reflection. In heterogeneous media, the Fresnel volume around an image point is approximated by means of paraxial ray tracing. The method is tested on a synthetic vertical seismic profiling experiment with strongly limited aperture. Migration artifacts and crosstalk effects from converted waves are strongly reduced compared with standard migration schemes. The method is successfully applied to seismic data acquired in a tunnel.",10.1190/1.2127114
Time‐Lapse Inversion Of Crosswell Radar Data,"The combination of differential radar tomography with conventional tracer and/or hydraulic tests facilitates high‐resolution characterization of subsurface heterogeneity and enables the identification of preferential flow paths. In dynamic imaging, each tomogram is typically inverted independently, under the assumption that data sets are collected quickly relative to changes in the imaged property (e.g., attenuation or velocity); however, such ""snapshot"" tomograms may contain large errors if the imaged property changes significantly during data collection. Acquisition of less data over a shorter time interval could ameliorate the problem, but the resulting decrease in ray density and angular coverage could degrade model resolution. To address these problems, we propose a new sequential approach for time‐lapse tomographic inversion. The method uses space‐time parameterization and regularization to combine data collected at multiple times and to account for temporal variation. The inverse algorithm minimizes the sum of weighted squared residuals and a measure of solution complexity based on an a priori space‐time covariance function and a spatiotemporally variable mean. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic 2‐D time‐lapse (x,z,t) data set based loosely on a field experiment in which difference‐attenuation radar tomography was used to monitor the migration of a saline tracer in fractured rock. We quantitatively show the benefits of space‐time inversion by comparing results for snapshot and time‐lapse inversion schemes. Inversion over both space and time results in superior estimation error, model resolution, and data reproduction compared to conventional snapshot inversion. Finally, we suggest strategies to improve time‐lapse cross‐hole inversions using ray‐based inversion constraints and a modified survey design in which different sets of rays are collected in alternating time steps.",10.1190/1.1527075
Rayleigh‐Wave Motion In An Elastic Half‐Space,"Measurements made on Rayleigh waves below the surface of a simulated elastic half‐space confirm in detail the behavior predicted by theory. These measurements, made by means of a two‐dimensional seismic model, show that the amplitude of the Rayleigh wave falls off rapidly with increasing depth.",10.1190/1.1439550
A Method Of Determining A Preferred P‐Wave Velocity Profile In A Borehole Using Surface Explosions,"The interpretation of seismic velocity variations in crystalline rocks in terms of fracture parameters requires velocity measurements with errors no greater than 1–2 percent. To achieve optimum resolution, we have devised a method of calculating P velocity‐depth profiles from crystal‐cable well surveys that makes maximum use of the data redundancy. Relative time corrections are computed iteratively for the entire set of shots using the overlapping portions of the hydrophone array between consecutive shots. From the resulting travel time versus distance curve, a family of possible velocity solutions is obtained for data windows of various lengths using Bolt's modification of the method of summary values devised by Jeffreys. Trade‐off curves between the number of data points in the window and the variance of the velocity estimates are then drawn for different regions of the velocity profile. This enables a preferred solution to be constructed for each section of the velocity profile. The preferred velocity‐depth curve for a region of a gneiss‐monzonite rock body at depths between 25 and 254 m shows minima that correlate with the positions of major fractures or high concentrations of fractures inferred from optical examination of core samples, laboratory measurement of velocities, and tube wave studies.",10.1190/1.1441719
Fundamentals Of Electromagnetic Methodology,"The development of electromagnetic prospecting instruments has progressed rapidly in the last decade, particularly in Canada and Sweden. The introduction of miniaturized electronic circuits has permitted the construction of highly portable, sophisticated instruments. Consequently there is a large number of portable and installed EM units in current use all over the world.",10.1190/1.1439800
Estimation Of Fracture Parameters From Reflection Seismic Data—Part I: Hti Model Due To A Single Fracture Set,"The simplest effective model of a formation containing a single fracture system is transversely isotropic with a horizontal symmetry axis (HTI). Reflection seismic signatures in HTI media, such as NMO velocity and amplitude variation with offset (AVO) gradient, can be conveniently described by the Thomsen‐type anisotropic parameters ε(V), δ(V), and γ(V). Here, we use the linear slip theory of Schoenberg and co‐workers and the models developed by Hudson and Thomsen for pennyshaped cracks to relate the anisotropic parameters to the physical properties of the fracture network and to devise fracture characterization procedures based on surface seismic measurements. Concise expressions for ε(V), δ(V), and γ(V) linearized in the crack density, show a substantial difference between the values of the anisotropic parameters for isolated fluid‐filled and dry (gas‐filled) penny‐sh aped cracks. While the dry‐crack model is close to elliptical with  ε(V)≈δ(V), for thin fluid‐filled cracks ε(V);≈0 and the absolute value of δ(V) for typical VS/VP, ratios in the background is close to the crack density. The parameters ε(V) and δ(V) for models with partial saturation or hydraulically connected cracks and pores always lie between the values for dry and isolated fluid‐filled cracks. We also demonstrate that all possible pairs of ε(V) and δ(V) occupy a relatively narrow triangular area in the [ε(V), δ(V)]-plane, which can be used to identify the fracture‐induced HTI model from seismic data. The parameter δ(V), along with the fracture orientation, can be obtained from the P-wave NMO ellipse for a horizontal reflector. Given δ(V), the NMO velocity of a dipping event or nonhyperbolic moveout can be inverted for ε(V). The remaining anisotropic coefficient, γ(V), can be determined from the constraint on the parameters of vertically fractured HTI media if an estimate of the VS/VP, ratio is available. Alternatively, it is possible to find γ(V) by combining the NMO ellipse for horizontal events with the azimuthal variation of the P-wave AVO gradient. Also, we present a concise approximation for the AVO gradient of converted (PS) modes and show that all three relevant anisotropic coefficients of HTI media can be determined by the joint inversion of the AVO gradients or NMO velocities of P- and PS-waves. For purposes of evaluating the properties of the fractures, it is convenient to recalculate the anisotropic coefficients into the normal (ΔN) and tangential (ΔT) weaknesses of the fracture system. If the HTI model results from penny‐shaped cracks, ΔT gives a direct estimate of the crack density and the ratio ΔN/ΔT is a sensitive indicator of fluid saturation. However, while there is a substantial difference between the values of ΔN/ΔT for isolated fluid‐filled cracks and dry cracks, interpretation of intermediate values of ΔN/ΔT for porous rocks requires accounting for the hydraulic interaction between cracks and pores.",10.1190/1.1444863
Quantitative Estimation Of Intrinsic Induced Polarization And Superparamagnetic Parameters From Airborne Electromagnetic Data,"The primary aim of my research is to improve the characterization of induced polarization (IP) responses in airborne electromagnetic (AEM) survey data. The principal objectives are to test alternative methodologies for quantitative modeling and inversion to extract the spatial variation of IP parameters using the inductively thin-sheet model. The methods tested first fit, by nonnegative least squares, an AEM decay to the early delay time data, using thin-sheet basis functions. This modeled AEM decay is assumed to represent the IP source. It is then convolved with a few Cole-Cole models spanning the range of parameter sensitivity to get IP basis functions appropriate for the AEM excitation. Method 1 fits a linear sum of several AEM basis functions plus one IP basis function at a time and chooses the model with least-fitting error at late delay times. Method 2 fits a linear sum of several IP and several AEM basis functions. Both methods fit IP affected airborne data well, with normalized fitting errors being reduced by a significant factor when IP affects the data and is taken into account. Using penalty weights, superparamagnetic (SPM) effects can be simultaneously estimated in the fitting process. Without such weighting, SPM and IP parameter estimations are unstable. Cole-Cole models predict that the sensitivity of inductive airborne IP collected at 25 or 30 Hz base frequency indicates little overlap with galvanic ground IP collected with a 0.125 Hz waveform. Many easy IP sulfide targets with IP physical properties determined by ground surveys are predicted not to have a detectable airborne IP response. Clays, however, are predicted to have a small detectable background response that for airborne data would not be well-fitted by a single Cole-Cole response.",10.1190/geo2016-0110.1
The Multicoil Ii Airborne Electromagnetic System,"A helicopter‐towed electromagnetic (EM) system has been developed with two orthogonal transmitter coils. Units currently in service have either two or three orthogonal receiver coils. The associated software yields in‐phase and quadrature channels which are generally free of the conductive response of overburden and of the magnetic induction response of magnetite. These geologic noise sources can mask the response of bedrock conductors for all previously developed airborne EM (AEM) systems. The new technique involves energizing conductors with two orthogonal transmitter coils, both operating at approximately the same frequency (e.g., 900 Hz). The subtracting of the secondary field components of one maximum‐coupled coil pair from the other yields in‐phase and quadrature difference channels. These channels may contain as much as an order‐of‐magnitude increase in the signal/noise (S/N) ratio for bedrock conductors in a geologically noisy environment. The new system can also indicate whether a steeply dipping conductor is thin (e.g., width less than 3 m) or thick (greater than 10 m). The thickness parameter provides a new criterion for conductor sorting, complementing the usual parameters of conductance and strike‐length. The geophysical data are digitally recorded, and the profile records and maps are plotted by computer. The traces include the basic recorded data, the EM difference channels, a channel of resistivity, and a channel of conductance. The conductance channel essentially is an automatic anomaly selector calibrated in mhos. The usual application of the system is for metallic mineral prospecting. However, the system has also been used for sand and gravel detection using two well separated frequencies. For such applications, apparent resistivities are computed for each frequency and are displayed as channels on the profile record and as contour maps.",10.1190/1.1441013
Spectra Of Water Reverberations For Primary And Multiple Reflections,"A theoretical study shows that passage of a seismic event through the water‐layer filter imposes amplitude characteristics on the resultant reverberating event which are independent of whether the event is a primary reflection or a multiple reflection. The phase characteristics of each order of event are, however, different. It is also shown that the reverberating sequence from a multiple reflection can be ""whitened"" by deconvolution but will still exhibit ringing. This phenomenon explains why some marine data, containing dominantly multiple reflections, are not amenable to deringing using standard deconvolution approaches. In addition, a quick method of obtaining the approximate reflection coefficient of the sea floor is derived.",10.1190/1.1440300
"Mapping Plate Boundaries Using Tem Method Along The Longitudinal Valley, Taiwan","The transient electromagnetic (TEM) method was used to map plate boundaries in the Longitudinal Valley (LV), Taiwan. The SIROTEM in‐loop configuration with square transmitting loops 90 to 200 m on a side were used for this survey. More than 350 soundings were conducted in the valley. The field data were inverted by a smooth model inversion, and the soundings resolved more than 300 m beneath the LV. A set of geoelectric maps containing horizontal slices at different depths and vertical profiles from north to south along the LV have been constructed based on these inversion results. Based on the TEM sounding results, one predominant electrical discontinuity can be recognized in the LV that agrees well with the known suture trace on the surface between the Philippine Sea and the Eurasian plates. Moreover, the fact that the sedimentation trend thickened southward in the LV supports the geologic viewpoint that the LV is undergoing severe compression‐closure action; the northern part of the valley seems to have been closed already, whereas the southern part has not.",10.1190/1.1444397
Prestack Migration By Split‐Step Dsr,"The double‐square‐root (DSR) prestack migration equation, though defined for depth variable velocity, can be used to image media with strong velocity variations using a phase‐shift plus interpolation (PSPI) or split‐step correction. The split‐step method is based on applying a phase‐shift correction to the extrapolated wavefield—a correction that attempts to compensate for the lateral velocity variations. I show how to extend DSR prestack migration to lateral velocity media and exemplify the method by applying the new algorithm to the Marmousi data set. The split‐step DSR migration is very fast and offers excellent imaging results.",10.1190/1.1444065
3D Interpolation Of Irregular Data With A Pocs Algorithm,"Seismic surveys generally have irregular areas where data cannot be acquired. These data should often be interpolated. A projection onto convex sets (POCS) algorithm using Fourier transforms allows interpolation of irregularly populated grids of seismic data with a simple iterative method that produces high-quality results. The original 2D image restoration method, the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, is extended easily to higher dimensions, and the 3D version of the process used here produces much better interpolations than typical 2D methods. The only parameter that makes a substantial difference in the results is the number of iterations used, and this number can be overestimated without degrading the quality of the results. This simplicity is a significant advantage because it relieves the user of extensive parameter testing. Although the cost of the algorithm is several times the cost of typical 2D methods, the method is easily parallelized and still completely practical.",10.1190/1.2356088
Stable Inversion Of Gravity Anomalies Of Sedimentary Basins With Nonsmooth Basement Reliefs And Arbitrary Density Contrast Variations,"We present a new, stable method for interpreting the basement relief of a sedimentary basin which delineates sharp discontinuities in the basement relief and incorporates any law known a priori for the spatial variation of the density contrast. The subsurface region containing the basin is discretized into a grid of juxtaposed elementary prisms whose density contrasts are the parameters to be estimated. Any vertical line must intersect the basement relief only once, and the mass deficiency must be concentrated near the earth's surface, subject to the observed gravity anomaly being fitted within the experimental errors. In addition, upper and lower bounds on the density contrast of each prism are introduced a priori (one of the bounds being zero), and the method assigns to each elementary prism a density contrast which is close to either bound. The basement relief is therefore delineated by the contact between the prisms with null and nonnull estimated density contrasts, the latter occupying the upper part of the discretized region. The method is stabilized by introducing constraints favoring solutions having the attributes (shared by most sedimentary basins) of being an isolated compact source with lateral borders dipping either vertically or toward the basin center and having horizontal dimensions much greater than its largest vertical dimension. Arbitrary laws of spatial variations of the density contrast, if known a priori, may be incorporated into the problem by assigning suitable values to the nonnull bound of each prism. The proposed method differs from previous stable methods by using no smoothness constraint on the interface to be estimated. As a result, it may be applied not only to intracratonic sag basins where the basement relief is essentially smooth but also to rift basins whose basements present discontinuities caused by faults. The method's utility in mapping such basements was demonstrated in tests using synthetic data produced by simulated rift basins. The method mapped with good precision a sequence of step faults which are close to each other and present small vertical slips, a feature particularly difficult to detect from gravity data only. The method was also able to map isolated discontinuities with large vertical throw. The method was applied to the gravity data from Reco⁁ncavo basin, Brazil. The results showed close agreement with known geological structures of the basin. It also demonstrated the method's ability to map a sequence of alternating terraces and structural lows that could not be detected just by inspecting the gravity anomaly. To demostrate the method's flexibility in incorporating any a priori knowledge about the density contrast variation, it was applied to the Bouguer anomaly over the San Jacinto Graben, California. Two different exponential laws for the decrease of density contrast with depth were used, leading to estimated maximum depths between 2.2 and 2.4 km.",10.1190/1.1444585
A Comparison Of The Correlation Structure In Gpr Images Of Deltaic And Barrier‐Spit Depositional Environments,"We have used geostatistical analysis of radar reflections to quantify the correlation structures found in 2-D ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) images. We find that the experimental semivariogram, the product of the geostatistical analysis of the GPR data, is well‐defined and can be modeled using standard geostatistical models to obtain an estimate of the range or correlation length, and the maximum correlation direction, in the 2-D GPR image. When we compare the results from geostatistical analysis of GPR data from selected deltaic and barrier‐spit depositional environments we find different correlation structures in GPR images from different depositional environments. GPR images from braid deltas have near‐horizontal correlation directions and correlation lengths on the order of a few meters. In contrast, the GPR image of a fan‐foreset delta has a very long (24 m) correlation length and a maximum correlation direction plunging 20°. In the GPR images from barrier spits, we find maximum correlation directions that are horizontal or plunging a few degrees. The correlation lengths range from 7 to 43 m, depending on the orientation of the GPR image relative to spit end growth, and on the specific radar facies that is analyzed.",10.1190/1.1444807
Propagation Of A Pulse In A Fluid Sphere,"The exact solution obtained in a previous paper for the motion of a uniform compressible fluid sphere due to a pressure pulse from a point source situated below the surface is applied to a source at a distance of one‐eighth of the radius below the surface. Taking the sphere as a simplified model of the earth, this corresponds to a source at a depth of about 800 km, which is not far from the depth of a deep‐focus earthquake. The time variation of pressure due to the source is represented by the difference between two step functions with rounded shoulders. The surface velocity due to sources of different durations has been evaluated for eight angular distances. The solution exhibits step function type and ""logarithmic"" reftected pulses, which one would anticipate from the ""steepest descents"" analysis of Jeffreys and Lapwood. In addition, the solution reveals single diffracted pulses and groups of diffracted pulses which have no counterpart in ray theory. When geometrical optics allows a ray to appear only after a minimum range θ0 from the epicenter, the complete wave‐theoretical solution shows that these pulses show up earlier in the forbidden zones. Similarly, in the case where the geometrical optics predicts that a certain ray should appear only for ranges θθ0, and should not appear for θθ0, the wave‐theoretic solution shows that such a ray does appear, by diffraction, for some range of θθ0. Arrival times of the diffracted pulses of the first group increase with increasing θ, while for the second group they decrease with θ.",10.1190/1.1439358
Multicomponent Seismology—The Next Wave,"Multicomponent seismology requires recording of seismic data with three‐ and sometimes four‐component receivers. The three components measure displacement of the ground, usually in two horizontal and one vertical directions. The fourth component is a measurement of pressure, which is used in sea‐bottom surveys. Measuring three components of ground displacement enables the recording of compressional (P) and shear (S) waves which represent the full complement of ""body"" waves in seismology. Earthquake seismologists have been using the full complement for years to interpret the structure of our living planet; however, exploration seismologists have been slow to bring multicomponent seismology to the forefront of their measurement system. This is finally changing. Thanks to new seismic acquisition recording systems, it is now feasible to economically record multicomponent seismic data in both land and marine (sea‐bottom) settings. In the future, all land or sea‐bottom seismic data will be recorded by multicomponent technology, thereby bringing us the next wave of exploration geophysics as we begin to ""see the unseen.""",10.1190/1.1444920
Numerical Analysis Of The Azimuth Moveout Operator For Vertically Inhomogeneous Media,"The azimuth‐moveout (AMO) operator, unlike the dip‐moveout (DMO) operator, has a 3D structure in homogeneous isotropic media, with an out‐of‐plane (crossline) component. In general, this component is concave downward, giving the operator an overall skewed‐saddle shape. The AMO operator, necessary for azimuth correction only, is typically smaller in size than conventional DMO operators, which corresponds to purely offset correction to zero offset. When velocity varies vertically, the operator shape changes depending on the degree of velocity variation. The general shape of the operator, however, remains saddlelike. In fact, for smooth velocity increases with depth, similar to those found in the Gulf of Mexico, the v(z) AMO operator does not differ much from its homogeneous counterpart. In this case, the residual AMO operator, constructed by cascading a forward homogeneous AMO operator with an inverse v(z) one, is extremely small, which suggests that the impact of such v(z) variations on the AMO operator is generally small. Complex vertical velocity variations, on the other hand, result in more complicated AMO operators that include, among other things, triplications at moderate angles. Regardless of the complexity of the model, the v(z) operator has the same first‐order behavior as its homogeneous counterpart. As a result, for small dip angles the homogeneous AMO, as a tool for partial stacking, often enhances the image. Moderate to steep dips in complex v(z) media requires the application of an algorithm that honors such velocity variations.",10.1190/1.1707075
The Effect Of Dielectric Permittivity On The Fields Radiated From A Radio-Frequency Electric Dipole In A Homogeneous Whole Space,First presented at the SEG 84th Annual International Meeting.,10.1190/geo2015-0219.1
Joint Diagonalization Applied To The Detection And Discrimination Of Unexploded Ordnance,"Efforts to discriminate buried unexploded ordnance from harmless surrounding clutter are often hampered by the uncertainty in the number of buried targets that produce a given detected signal. We present a technique that helps determine that number with no need for data inversion. The procedure is based on the joint diagonalization of a set of multistatic response (MSR) matrices measured at different time gates by a time-domain electromagnetic induction sensor. In particular, we consider the Naval Research Laboratory's Time-Domain Electromagnetic Multisensor Towed Array Detection System (TEMTADS), which consists of a 5×5 square grid of concentric transmitter/receiver pairs. The diagonalization process itself generalizes one of the standard procedures for extracting the eigenvalues of a single matrix; in terms of execution time, it is comparable to diagonalizing the matrices one by one. We present the method, discuss and illustrate its mathematical basis and physical meaning, and apply it to several actual measurements carried out with TEMTADS at a test stand and in the field at the former Camp Butner in North Carolina. We find that each target in a measurement is associated with a set of nonzero time-dependent MSR eigenvalues (usually three), which enables estimation of the number of targets interrogated. These eigenvalues have a characteristic shape as a function of time that does not change with the location and orientation of the target relative to the sensor. We justify analytically and empirically that symmetric targets have pairs of eigenvalues with constant ratios between them.",10.1190/geo2011-0387.1
Geophysical Exploration For Gold—A Review,"It is almost impossible to get a direct geophysical response from gold because of the low grades in deposits, except when electromagnetic detectors are used for individual shallow nuggets. However, indirect geophysical indications may occur through association of gold with particular host rocks, marker beds, or structures which are, for example, of unusual magnetization, density, electric polarization, or conductivity/resistivity. Useful markers may be magnetic dolerites, banded iron formations, shales with magnetite, conductive and/or polarizable pyrites, or other sulfide (detectable by IP methods) and silicified zones more resistive than surrounding rocks. Mapping of faults and shear zones, with which gold may be associated, is also valuable (e.g., by magnetic, EM surveys, etc.). Magnetite depletion is characteristic of some deposits, resulting in zones of low anomalies; for example, ferromagnetic minerals in mafic volcanics are destroyed by carbonatization. Resistivity patterns may indicate altered rocks which contain mineralization, thus the use of VLF-EM methods in Canada and MMR in Australia. Geophysical methods have been important in the search for gold in the Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa (magnetic, gravity, and even seismic reflection methods), various areas of Canada, e.g., the Abitibi greenstone belt (magnetic, EM, and IP surveys), and to a smaller extent in Australia (e.g., Tennant Creek, NT and Water Tank Hill, WA). However, the value of geophysical methods should not be exaggerated since physical contrasts are often low.",10.1190/1.1442820
Elastic Waves In Finely Layered Sediments: The Equivalent Medium And Generalized O'Doherty‐Anstey Formulas,"We study the influence of elastic 1-D inhomogeneous random media (e.g., finely layered media with variable density and shear and compressional velocities) on the kinematics and dynamics of the transmitted obliquely incident P‐ and SV‐plane waves. Multiple scattering (resulting in localization and spatial dispersion of the elastic wavefield) is the main physical effect controlling the properties of the wavefield in such media. We analyze the wave propagation assuming the fluctuations of velocities and density to be small (of the order of 20% or smaller). We obtain explicit analytic solutions for the attenuation coefficient and phase velocity of the transmitted waves. These solutions are valid for all frequencies. They agree very well with results of numerical modeling. Our theory shows that fine elastic multilayering is characterized by a frequency‐dependent anisotropy. At typical acquisition frequencies this anisotropy differs significantly from the low‐frequency anisotropy described by the well‐known Backus averaging. The increase of the phase velocity with frequency is quantified. It can partly explain the difference between well‐log‐derived velocities and lower frequency seismic velocities [e.g., vertical seismic profiling (VSP) velocities] in terms of localization. The low‐ and high‐frequency asymptotical results for the phase velocity agree with those of Backus averaging and ray approximation, respectively. The theory describes the angle‐dependent attenuation caused by multiple scattering. The proposed formulas are simple enough to be used in many practical applications as, e.g., in an amplitude variation with offset (AVO) analysis. They can be implemented for taking into account the angle dependence of transmission effects, or they can be used in an inversion for statistical parameters of sediments.",10.1190/1.1444052
Reflections From Multiple Transition Layers Part Ii—Experimental Investigation,It has been shown that the velocity of longitudinal waves in a nylon rod is a linear function of the temperature for the range 20°C. to 100°C. Use is made of this property to study reflections from multiple transition layers.,10.1190/1.1438463
Impact Of Rock-Physics Depth Trends And Markov Random Fields On Hierarchical Bayesian Lithology/Fluid Prediction,"Early assessments of petroleum reservoirs are usually based on seismic data and observations in a small number of wells. Decision-making concerning the reservoir will be improved if these data can be integrated and converted into a lithology/fluid map of the reservoir. We analyze lithology/fluid prediction in a Bayesian setting, based on prestack seismic data and well observations. The likelihood model contains a convolved linearized Zoeppritz relation and rock-physics models with depth trends caused by compaction and cementation. Well observations are assumed to be exact. The likelihood model contains several global parameters such as depth trend, wavelets, and error parameters; the inference of these is an integral part of the study. The prior model is based on a profile Markov random field parameterized to capture different continuity directions for lithologies and fluids. The posterior model captures prediction and model-parameter uncertainty and is assessed by Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulation-based inference. The inversion model is evaluated on a synthetic and a real data case. It is concluded that geologically plausible lithology/fluid predictions can be made. Rock physics depth trends have influence when cementation is present and/or predictions at depth outside the well range are made. Inclusion of model-parameter uncertainty makes the prediction uncertainties more realistic.",10.1190/1.3463475
A Method For Computation Of Velocity Profiles By Inversion Of Large‐Offset Records,"This paper describes a new method for recovering velocity profiles utilizing both phase and amplitude information including wide‐angle arrivals, post‐ and precritical reflections. This method is based on a double spatial transformation with a minimization procedure. The first transformation is slant stacking of the observed wave field (seismogram). The second is projecting the slant stacked wave field into the domain of horizontal slowness p and depth z. In this domain the inverse problem is reduced to finding the critical path p=V-1(z) where V(z) is the true velocity of the compressional waves. A numerical algorithm based on a minimization technique is used to find the critical path, which is equivalent to the set of turning points of the critically reflected rays. When this path is found, then the following criteria are satisfied: (1) most of the energy is concentrated away from the precritical region; (2) the computed reflection coefficients reach their maximum on this path; and (3) for horizontally stratified media or CMP data, the reflectors are aligned in the p-z domain. In tests, this method has been shown to recover the velocity profile from both synthetic and real data. It is shown that the method is able to recover accurately velocity profiles even if only part of the data are given. For example, only part of the data are available when low‐ and high‐frequency components are missing or when the data are truncated in lateral extent due to the finite length of the recording system. Moreover, the method is able to handle virtually any vertical velocity gradients in a medium; therefore, it can be applied to complicated geologic structures. The method does not require elimination of multiples, but it is not applicable to the case of a medium with a large lateral velocity gradient. It can be used even for an elastic medium when the mode‐converted energy is not small.",10.1190/1.1441753
Seismic Velocities Of Unconsolidated Sands: Part 2 — Influence Of Sorting- And Compaction-Induced Porosity Variation,"Unaccounted-for porosity variation in unconsolidated sediments can cloud the interpretation of the sediment's seismic velocities for factors such as fluid content and pressure. However, an understanding of the effects of porosity variation on the velocities can permit the remote characterization of porosity with seismic methods. We present the results of a series of measurements designed to isolate the effects of sorting- and compaction-induced porosity variation on the seismic velocities and their pressure dependences in clean, unconsolidated sands. We prepared a set of texturally similar sand and glass-bead samples with controlled grain-size distributions to cover an initial porosity range from 0.26 to 0.44. We measured the compressional- and shear-wave velocities and porosity of dry samples over a series of hydrostatic pressure cycles from   0.1 to 20 MPa  . Over this rangeof porosities, the velocities of the dry samples at a given pressure vary by   15%  . However, the water-saturated compressional-wave velocities, modeled with Gassmann fluid substitution, demonstrate a consistent increase with decreasing porosity. In both the dry and water-saturated cases, the porosity trend at a given pressure is approximately described by the isostress (harmonic) average between the moduli of the highest-porosity sample at that pressure and the moduli of quartz, the predominant mineral component of the samples. Empirical power-law fit coefficients describing the pressure dependences of the dry bulk, shear, and constrained (P-wave) moduli from each sample also demonstrate no significant, systematic relationship with the porosity. The porosity dependence of the water-saturated bulk and constrained moduli is primarily contained in the empirical coefficient representing the modulus at zero pressure.",10.1190/1.2364849
Monitoring Fluid Movement With The Borehole Gravity Meter,"Use of the borehole gravity (BHG) meter as a detector of density distribution suggests that a reservoir could be monitored for bulk density changes caused by redistribution of fluids after hydrocarbons have been partially extracted from it. In a simple situation in which liquid hydrocarbons are being extracted from a well, an overlying gas zone might begin to penetrate toward the perforations from above, while an underlying water‐zone formation might begin to penetrate toward the perforations from below. One idealized reservoir and one real reservoir are modeled for BHG meter responses in prepump and postpump reservoir conditions. Results suggest that the BHG meter density differences could be detected if the survey had a high degree of quality control.",10.1190/1.1442586
"Comparing Induced Polarization Responses From Airborne Inductive And Galvanic Ground Systems: Lewis Ponds, New South Wales","We have evaluated the mapping of polarizable material using a Cole-Cole model to fit second-order effects in concentric-loop airborne electromagnetic system responses. At Lewis Ponds in New South Wales, an inverted ground dipole-dipole array data has accurately imaged in 3D disseminated sulfide extending above and around ore grade massive sulfides. The polarizable zone is present in the near-surface, where, from modeling, airborne systems may have sensitivity to the small inductive induced polarization effects. Although the inverted chargeability measured from galvanic current injection into the ground was spatially coincident with the mineralized target, the estimated chargeabilities from induced polarization effects in an airborne versatile time-domain electromagnetic survey were substantially displaced to the east. The airborne induced polarization response may be associated with finer grained mineralization in the hanging wall of the sulfide deposits, or have a quite different source, such as clays associated with faulting.",10.1190/geo2016-0204.1
Automatic Time-Domain Velocity Estimation Based On An Accelerated Clustering Method,"Time-domain velocity and moveout parameters can be directly obtained from local event slopes, which are estimated on the prestack seismic gathers. In practice, there are always some errors in the estimated local slopes, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) situations. Thus, subsurface velocity information may be hidden in the image domain spanned by velocity and other moveout parameters. We have developed an accelerated clustering algorithm to find cluster centers without prior information about the number of clusters. First, plane-wave destruction is implemented to estimate the local event slopes. For every sample in the seismic gathers, we obtain the estimations of velocity and its location in the image domain, according to the local event slopes. These mapped data points in the new domain exhibit the structure of groups. We represent these points by a mixture distribution model. Then, the cluster centers of the mixture distribution model are located, which correspond to maximum likelihood velocities of the main subsurface structures. Approximate velocity uncertainties bounds are used to select centers corresponding to reflections. Finally, interpolation is performed on the clustered unevenly sampled knot velocities to build the effective velocity model on regular grids. With synthetic and field data examples, we have determined that the proposed automatic velocity estimation method can give a stacking velocity model and a time migration velocity model with relatively high accuracy.",10.1190/geo2015-0313.1
Apparent Resistivity Of A Perfectly Conducting Sphere Buried In A Half‐Space,"Recently, the application of the method of images to obtain apparent resistivity of a perfectly conducting sphere buried in a half‐space has been criticized on the grounds that the number of images needed is too large. Instead, use of the method of graphs, in conjuction with the method of images, has been suggested. Although the number of images needed is large, they are easy to compute and many of them occupy the same position, thereby the amount of necessary computation is drastically reduced. A computer program based on the method of images is used to give normalized total‐field apparent resistivity contours for bipole‐dipole arrays. Such theoretical contours can be used to locate the epicenter of a conductive buried sphere by comparing them with field data.",10.1190/1.1440646
"Degrading Permafrost Mapped With Electrical Resistivity Tomography, Airborne Imagery And Lidar, And Seasonal Thaw Measurements","Accurate identification of the relationships between permafrost extent and landscape patterns can help to develop airborne geophysical or remote sensing tools to map permafrost in remote locations or across large areas. These tools will be particularly applicable in discontinuous permafrost where climate warming or disturbances such as human development or fire can lead to rapid permafrost degradation. We have linked field-based geophysical, point-scale, and imagery surveying measurements to map permafrost at five fire scars (1930, 1975, 1988, 2001, and 2010) on the Tanana Flats in central Alaska. Ground-based elevation surveys, seasonal thaw-depth profiles, and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) measurements were combined with airborne imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to identify relationships between permafrost geomorphology and elapsed time since fire disturbance. ERT proved to be a robust technique for mapping the presence or absence of permafrost because of the marked difference in resistivity values for frozen versus unfrozen material. There was no clear relationship between elapsed time since fire and permafrost extent at our sites. However, we have found that the transition zone boundaries between permafrost soils and unfrozen soils in the collapse-scar bogs at our sites had complex and unpredictable morphologies. This result suggested that attempts to quantify the presence or absence of permafrost using aerial measurements alone could lead to incomplete results. Taken in total, the results from our study indicated that although ground-based ERT measurements were the most rapid means of mapping permafrost, we were still limited in being able to apply airborne surveying measurements at the landscape scale toward accurately estimating permafrost extent.",10.1190/geo2015-0149.1
Multimodel Adaptive Subtraction With Regularized Parameter Selection Via Generalized Information Criterion,"Adaptive subtraction remains a critical part of today's seismic data processing. Many existing adaptive subtraction methods can be formulated as a parameter estimation problem, and all of them, although fundamentally different, have a common restriction that the dimension of the unknown parameters must be determined in advance. We have developed an adaptive subtraction framework called multimodel adaptive subtraction (MMAS) that aims to relax this restriction as well as regularize the estimation of the parameters through a generalized information criterion combined with a nonconcave penalized likelihood function. MMAS is a fully general framework that can be applied to many existing adaptive subtraction methods. As an example, we determined how MMAS can be applied to the popular least-squares adaptive subtraction (LSAS) method, and we call the resulting algorithm the multimodel LSAS (MMASLS); furthermore, we studied its computational complexity and developed an efficient implementation for MMASLS. We applied our proposed MMASLS method in the context of multiple attenuation, and we used computer simulations to demonstrate the advantages of our method over the traditional LSAS method, which included the capabilities to be more aggressive (use longer filters) in regions in which multiples occurred, to be less aggressive (use smaller filters) in regions dominated by primary reflections, and to be passive and take no effect (no filters used) in regions in which multiples were absent from the data.",10.1190/geo2014-0474.1
Automatic Estimation Of Large Residual Statics Corrections,"Conventional approaches to residual statics estimation obtain solutions by performing linear inversion of observed traveltime deviations. A crucial component of these procedures is picking time delays; gross errors in these picks are known as ""cycle skips"" or ""leg jumps"" and are the bane of linear traveltime inversion schemes. This paper augments Rothman (1985), which demonstrated that the estimation of large statics in noise‐contaminated data is posed better as a nonlinear, rather than as a linear, inverse problem. Cycle skips then appear as local (secondary) minima of the resulting nonlinear optimization problem. In the earlier paper, a Monte Carlo technique from statistical mechanics was adapted to perform global optimization, and the technique was applied to synthetic data. Here I present an application of a similar Monte Carlo method to field data from the Wyoming Overthrust belt. Key changes, however, have led to a more efficient and practical algorithm. The new technique performs explicit crosscorrelation of traces. Instead of picking the peaks of these crosscorrelation functions, the method transforms the crosscorrelation functions to probability distributions and then draws random numbers from the distributions. Estimates of statics are now iteratively updated by this procedure until convergence to the optimal stack is achieved. Here I also derive several theoretical properties of the algorithm. The method is expressed as a Markov chain, in which the equilibrium (steady‐state) distribution is the Gibbs distribution of statistical mechanics.",10.1190/1.1442092
Relations Between Horizontal And Vertical Gradients Of Potential Fields,"Nabighian (1984) and Nelson (1986) have both derived relations between horizontal and vertical gradients of magnetic fields (or any other potential field), whereby a knowledge of one enables one to calculate the other. As pointed out by Nelson, Nabighian's derivation is quite lengthy. In the following, I offer an alternative derivation in the wavenumber domain, which is even shorter than that given by Nelson.",10.1190/1.1442694
2-D Electrical Modeling Over Undulated Topography,"The electrical response of a cylindrical inclusion in topographic relief has been treated analytically for a uniform electric field. The undulated topography has been conveniently defined by a smoothly connected mathematical surface defining a hump or bump. A Born approximation of Laplace's equation in a bipolar coordinate system has been derived by solving for the mixed‐boundary conditions, namely Neumann and Dirichlet conditions, respectively. The topographic relief causes focusing and defocusing at the transition zones of flat and topographic relief and the central zone of the hump. Consequently, the electric field is weakly linear within the flat zone and entirely nonlinear within the hump. The inclusion of a cylindrical target aggravates the field nonlinearity. The electric field and induced polarization (IP) response over the cylindrical target embedded in topographic relief are strongly dependent on the width and height of the hump and a steady function of increase in resistivity (ρ2/ρ1) as well as chargeability (m2-m1) contrasts. The electrical field and IP response over the cylindrical target embedded in the topographic relief, after correcting for topographic effect, resembles most closely the field measured on an equivalent flat half‐space of a particular elevation. The areas of the topographic surface above and below this unique datum bisecting the topographic relief are exactly equal.",10.1190/1.1444400
Continuously Time‐Variable Recursive Digital Band‐Pass Filters For Seismic Signal Processing,"A design technique is described for continuously time‐variable recursive digital band‐pass filters for seismic signal processing. Two types of band‐pass filters are considered: a cascade of a low‐pass and a high‐pass filter, and a direct band‐pass filter, with all filters being derived from a continuous unit‐bandwidth Butterworth low‐pass prototype. Linear interpolation of the filter coefficients between points at which they are known exactly is used to reduce the computational overhead. Data are given for determining the length of the interpolation interval to meet prescribed worst case magnitude and frequency error criteria. A zero‐phase response is achieved by filtering in the forward time direction followed by filtering in the reverse time direction. An example is included.",10.1190/1.1441500

North American Gravity And Magnetic Anomaly Workshops,"The North American Gravity and Magnetic Anomaly Map Workshops, realizing the importance of regional gravity and magnetic anomalies to investigating the structure and composition of the earth, enthusiastically support the preparation of North American gravity and magnetic anomaly maps. Sufficient magnetic and gravity anomaly data are available over the North American continent, the Caribbean, and adjacent marine areas to produce geologically meaningful maps. These maps will be published within the decade at a scale of 1:5 million on the same map base being used by a variety of organizations to produce other geologic/geochemical/geophysical maps in cooperation with the Geological Society of America's Centennial Map Series. The anomaly maps will be published in color with transparent overlays also available. The gravity anomaly map will be contoured at a 10 mgal interval using Bouguer anomalies onshore corrected wherever possible and necessary for terrain effects and free‐air anomalies offshore. Existing or soon to be completed magnetic and gravity anomaly maps of Canada, the U.S., and Mexico will provide the nuclei for preparing the North American maps. Programs for producing these maps in a timely manner are organized based upon a series of committees and the cooperation of agencies of the involved North American nations.",10.1190/1.1441170
Processing Of Surface-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Data From Sites With High Noise Levels,"The applicability of surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in investigations of groundwater is often limited by high noise levels in many areas of interest. We have evaluated measurements from a high-noise-level area in Ristrup, Denmark, recorded with a Numis Poly instrument. Standard multichannel filtering techniques for noise reduction are inadequate for several data sets acquired in this area, and surface-NMR signals cannot be resolved from the acquired data. Based on a careful assessment of the frequency content of the data, we have determined how a model-based noise reduction approach can be generalized and used to subtract two harmonic noise components from the data. Reliable surface-NMR data can be extracted from the noise-reduced data. Moreover, we have determined the impact of the proposed processing approaches on our inversion results, and we have also developed an example in which the proposed methodology allowed us to reveal and avoid an otherwise overlooked contamination of the reference coil signals with a surface-NMR signal. No borehole data were available for the investigated sites, and the validity of the noise reduction approach was instead verified using a synthetic five-layer model embedded in noise-only records from Ristrup. Our results have determined that a careful processing of the recorded data made it possible to extract surface-NMR data in more places of interest.",10.1190/geo2015-0441.1
The New Gravity System—Changes In International Gravity Base Values And Anomaly Values,"An assessment is made of (1) the reliability of the changes in the absolute gravity datum and standard incorporated in the IGSN 71 values of Morelli et al (1974), and (2) the effect of these changes and those incorporated in the new international gravity formula (Geodetic Reference System 1967) defining theoretical gravity values at sea level on gravity anomaly values. Pendulum‐interval comparisons with modern absolute gravity intervals between Washington, D.C.; Teddington, England; Paris, France; and Potsdam, East Germany indicate that the correction of 14 mgal to the Potsdam datum is correct to within .03 ± .016 mgal. Although there appear to be occasional discrepancies in the IGSN 71 values of the order of 0.1 mgal, in general their reliability appears to approximate ±0.05 mgal. A discrepancy of approximately −0.03 mgal per 1000 mgal of absolute gravity is indicated, however, in the gravity standard defined by the IGSN 71 values over the range of modern absolute gravity determinations between Fairbanks, Alaska and Bogotá, Colombia. An evaluation of the earlier attempt to standardize gravity on a global scale (Woollard and Rose, 1963) indicates a mean datum difference of 14.7 mgal (standard deviation 0.2 mgal) relative to IGSN 71 values at 776 sites having a worldwide distribution. No discernible difference in gravity standard from that of the IGSN 71 values is indicated except in South America, where the Woollard and Rose values are found to incorporate a difference in standard of O.2 mgal per 1000 mgal. It is shown that anomaly conversions from the old to the new gravity system can be effected directly using the old anomaly values. Two correction terms are required, specifically, (1) a constant representing the difference in base value used relative to the IGSN 71 value for the base, and (2) a latitude‐dependent term representing the difference in theoretical sea level gravity using the old International Gravity Formula (IGF) and the new GRS 67 formula. Test conversions of anomaly values on the old gravity system for regional areas involving data from several sources indicate that, in general, anomaly conversion to the new gravity system can be obtained with a reliability of about 0.3 to 0.5 mgal. The limiting factor is the unknown variation in gravimeter calibration standards represented.",10.1190/1.1441012
Instantaneous Velocities And Reflection Times For Transversely Isotropic Solids,"Whereas t2-X2 plots are straight lines for a reflection from a horizontal interface beneath an isotropic solid, the plots are curved for P‐waves and SV‐waves when the solid is transversely isotropic. Velocity and intercept time are normally found by fitting a least‐squares straight line to the t2-X2 data. However, we can define an instantaneous velocity and an instantaneous intercept time by fitting a tangent line to the t2-X2 plot at each X. We obtain expressions for instantaneous velocity and intercept time for a transversely isotropic solid in terms of the plane‐wave velocity v and plane‐wave angle from the vertical θ. We relate the instantaneous quantities to measurable quantities for waves from a point source. A method is suggested for finding the minimum source‐to‐geophone separation at which the velocity becomes essentially the velocity for travel in the horizontal direction.",10.1190/1.1441337
Predictive Deconvolution And The Zero‐Phase Source,"Predictive deconvolution is commonly applied to seismic data generated with a Vibroseisr® source. Unfortunately, when this process invokes a minimum‐phase assumption, the phase of the resulting trace will not be correct. Nonetheless, spiking deconvolution is an attractive process because it restores attenuated higher frequencies, thus increasing resolution. For detailed stratigraphic analyses, however, it is desirable that the phase of the data be treated properly as well. The most common solution is to apply a phase‐shifting filter that corrects for errors attributable to a zero‐phase source. The phase correction is given by the minimum‐phase spectrum of the correlated Vibroseis wavelet. Because no minimum‐phase spectrum truly exists for this bandlimited wavelet, white noise is added to its amplitude spectrum in order to design the phase‐correction filter. Different levels of white noise, however, produce markedly different results when field data sections are filtered. A simple argument suggests that the amount of white noise used should match that added in designing the (minimum‐phase) spiking deconvolution operator. This choice, however, also produces inconsistent results; field data again show that the phase treatment is sensitive to the amount of added white noise. Synthetic data tests show that the standard phase‐correction procedure breaks down when earth attenuation is severe. Deterministically reducing the earth‐filter effects before deconvolution improved the resulting phase treatment for the synthetic data. After application of the inverse attenuation filter to the field data, however, phase differences again remain for different levels of added white noise. These inconsistencies are attributable to the phase action of spiking deconvolution. This action is dependent upon the shape of the signal spectrum as well as the spectral shape and level of contaminating noise. Thus, in practice the proper treatment of phase in data-dependent processing requires extensive knowledge of the spectral characteristics of both signal and noise. With such knowledge, one could apply deterministic techniques that either eliminate the need for statistical deconvolution or condition the data so as to satisfy better the statistical model assumed in data‐dependent processing.",10.1190/1.1441674
Synthesis Of Multicomponent Quasi-P And Converted Quasi-P-S Seismograms For Intersecting Fracture Systems,"Dynamic ray shooting with interpolation is an economical way of computing approximate Green's functions in 3-D heterogeneous anisotropic media. The amplitudes, traveltimes, and polarizations of the reflected rays arriving at the surface are interpolated to synthesize three‐component seismograms at the desired recording points. The algorithm is applied to investigate kinematic quasi-P-wave propagation and converted quasi-P-S-wave splitting variations produced in reflections from the bottom of a layer containing two sets of intersecting dry vertical fractures as a function of the angle between the fracture sets and of the intensity of fracturing. An analytical expression is derived for the stiffness constant C16 that extends Hudson's second‐order scattering theory to include tetragonal-2 symmetry systems. At any offset, the amount of splitting in nonorthogonal (orthorhombic symmetry) intersecting fracture sets is larger than in orthogonal (tetragonal-1 symmetry) systems, and it increases nonlinearly as a function of the intensity of fracturing as offset increases. Such effects should be visible in field data, provided that the dominant frequency is sufficiently high and the offset is sufficiently large. The amount of shear‐wave splitting at vertical incidence increases nonlinearly as a function of the intensity of fracturing and increases nonlinearly from zero in the transition from tetragonal-1 anisotropy through orthorhombic to horizontal transverse isotropy; the latter corresponds to the two crack systems degenerating to one. The zero shear‐wave splitting corresponds to a singularity, at which the vertical velocities of the two quasi‐shear waves converge to a single value that is both predicted theoretically and illustrated numerically. For the particular case of vertical fractures, there is no P-to-S conversion of vertically propagating (zero‐offset) waves. If the fractures are not vertical, the normal incidence P-to-S reflection coefficient is not zero and thus is a potential diagnostic of fracture orientation.",10.1190/1.1444817
Electrical Conductance In A Porous Medium,"The Hanai‐Bruggeman equation is applied to a model of a conductive rock matrix immersed in water. The result is a general two‐component equation which relates the electrical properties of a formation to the electrical properties of the rock matrix and the water at any frequency. The low‐frequency limit is compared with previous theoretical and experimental work on sand formations. From a comparison of the three‐resistor model of Wyllie and Southwick, the Waxman‐Smits model, the dual water model of Clavier et al (1977) and the proposed model, it is found that the only representation which is viable, conceptually sound, and in agreement with experiment, is the last one.",10.1190/1.1441549
3-D Traveltimes And Amplitudes By Gridded Rays,"Seismic imaging in three dimensions requires the calculation of traveltimes and amplitudes of a wave propagating through an elastic medium. They can be computed efficiently and accurately by integrating the eikonal equation on an elemental grid using finite‐difference methods. Unfortunately, this approach to solving the eikonal equation is potentially unstable unless the grid sampling steps satisfy stability conditions or wavefront tracking algorithms are used. We propose a new method for computing traveltimes and amplitudes in 3-D media that is simple, fast, unconditionally stable, and robust. Defining the slowness vector as p=(px,py,pz) and assuming an isotropic medium, the ray velocity v is related to the slowness vector by the relation v=p/(p⋅p). Rays emerging from gridpoints on a horizontal plane are propagated downward a single vertical grid step to a new horizontal plane. The components of the slowness vector are then interpolated to gridpoints on this next horizontal plane. This is termed regridding; the process of downward propagation of rays, one vertical grid step at a time, is continued until some prescribed depth is reached. Computation of amplitudes is achieved using a method similar to that for obtaining the zero‐order approximation in asymptotic ray theory. We show comparisons with a full‐wave method on readily accessible 3-D velocity models.",10.1190/1.1444906
"Extracting Geoelectrical Maps From Vintage Very-Low-Frequency Airborne Data, Tipper Inversion, And Interpretation: A Case Study From Northern Sweden","In 1985, the mining company Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag collected airborne very-low-frequency (VLF) data in northern Sweden. The operators stored only the vertical component and the total magnetic field, which at that time were believed to be sufficient for qualitative interpretation. Therefore, the data could not be directly used for quantitative tensor VLF processing and inversion. To avoid the costs of resurveying, we have developed a novel technique to estimate the tippers from the measured VLF data by computing anomalous and normal parts of the horizontal components of the magnetic field from two transmitters separately. Retrieval of the normal horizontal components was possible because one component of the horizontal magnetic field was used as the phase reference during the measurements. Additionally, we have determined how the approximate apparent resistivity suitable for data visualization can be computed from the components of the magnetic field assuming an average normal resistivity of the subsurface. Maps of apparent resistivity combined with topography show a clear correlation between high topography and high resistivity, whereas conductive zones are found in valleys in between. More importantly, the 3D model inverted from the calculated tippers shows excellent agreement with a map of the surface geology. Based on this comparison, some less resistive zones can be related to fluids in fractures and others can be related to mineralized contact zones. We suggest to focus further exploration on conductive zones surrounding areas with basaltic composition.",10.1190/geo2015-0296.1
Application Of Dinoseis In Canada,"An experimental program was conducted to determine if a seismic system consisting of a Dinoseis, a digital recorder, and digital processing was adequate for solving exploration problems in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Several miles of data were collected and processed from three areas—Edson, Alberta; Bellshill Lake, Alberta; and Central Saskatchewan. Certain aspects exist which must be considered when using a low power, low frequency, surface source. These are ambient and coherent noise reduction, resolution of reflected events, and penetration of subsurface. They are attacked at different places in the total system by use of carefully‐designed field procedures and processing techniques. Methods of attack include stacking of multiple pulses taken at each shotpoint, selection of appropriate source and receiver arrays, common‐depth‐point coverage, and application of deconvolution and velocity and frequency filtering in the processing sequence. After processing the experimental data, a match was obtained between Central Saskatchewan Dinoseis traces and a synthetic seismogram over a frequency bandwidth of 20 to 65 cps. In Bellshill Lake and Edson, processed Dinoseis sections were comparable to processed dynamite sections, indicating that Dinoseis data was adequate to solve the geologic problem in both areas. Results are promising, and, coupled with favorable economics, warrant further exploitation of DinoSeis in Canada.",10.1190/1.1439921
"Marine Magnetotellurics For Petroleum Exploration, Part Ii: Numerical Analysis Of Subsalt Resolution","In areas where seismic imaging of the base of salt structures is difficult, seaborne electromagnetic techniques offer complementary as well as independent structural information. Numerical models of 2-D and 3-D salt structures demonstrate the capability of the marine magnetotelluric (MT) technique to map the base of the salt structures with an average depth accuracy of better than 10%. The mapping of the base of the salt with marine MT is virtually unaffected by internal variation within the salt. Three‐dimensional anticlinal structures with a horizontal aspect ratio greater than two can be interpreted adequately via two‐dimensional inversions. Marine MT can distinguish between salt structures which possess deep vertical roots and those which do not. One measure of the relative accuracy of MT and seismic methods can be made by considering the vertical and lateral position errors in the locations of interfaces caused by neglecting velocity anisotropy in migration. For the shallow part of the section where two‐way travel times are on the order of 1 s, the vertical and lateral position errors in the locations of salt‐sediment interfaces from 2-D MT inversion is more than twice the expected migration error in reflectors in transversely isotropic sediments, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico. Deeper in the section where two‐way times are on the order of 4 s, lateral position errors in migration become comparable to those of the MT inverse, whereas seismic vertical position errors remain more than a factor of two smaller than MT errors. This analysis shows that structural mapping accuracy would be improved using MT and seismic together.",10.1190/1.1444394
Combining Attenuation By Q And Spherical Divergence,"A general correlation of cross‐well seismic data and surface seismic data is attempted simply by examining a combination of the two major mechanisms of seismic wave attenuation, anelastic Q, and spherical divergence. High‐frequency cross‐well seismology can be hindered by the assumption that an order of magnitude increase in frequency is accompanied by an order of magnitude decrease in propagation distance such that the anelastic attenuation (described by quality factor Q) remains constant. Such a comparison, however, neglects the effects of geometrical spreading, which is independent of frequency. Through the consideration of both Q and spherical divergence, it is demonstrated that the total attenuation of 2 000 Hz energy at a distance of 613 m is equivalent to the total attenuation of 20 Hz energy at a distance of 7 000 m. Applications of kilohertz cross‐well seismic surveys between wells spaced by over 600 m could be possible with present dynamic‐range capabilities in seismic recording systems. Such applications would allow the use of high‐resolution cross‐well seismic surveys between wells drilled on a 40 acre spacing. One example of cross‐well seismic data is shown to demonstrate the high‐frequency content (kilohertz) which can be obtained. Theoretical calculations indicate that kilohertz energy could be recorded at distances up to 1 km. The assumptions are that present surface seismology measurements define the dynamic‐range capabilities of recording instruments, and that Q with spherical divergence accounts for all attenuation. All calculations neglect the problems of miniaturization required for downhole applications. The goal is that omission of extremely low Q regions near the surface and the noise‐free borehole environment can overcome the miniaturization problems.",10.1190/1.1442340
The Electromagnetic Response Of An Inhomogeneous Layered Earth—A General One‐Dimensional Approach,"The electromagnetic response is studied for a model three‐layer earth formed by constant conductivity in the first and the third layers and conductivity varying with depth in the second layer (i.e., the inhomogeneous transition layer). A generalization to the case of many constant or variable conductivity layers is presented, too. The model problem is addressed by numerically solving an initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation for the inhomogeneous transition layer. The applicability of the procedure proposed, which is limited by the numerical method used, is discussed. As an illustration, the computed apparent resistivities and phases are compared with the results of Kao and Rankin (1980). The technique presented is applied to the computation of the response in the very‐low frequency (VLF) method. Application to other methods employing the plane wave is similar.",10.1190/1.1441922
Correction Of Topographic Distortions In Potential‐Field Data: A Fast And Accurate Approach,"The equivalent source concept is used in the wavenumber domain to correct distortions in potential‐field data caused by topographic relief. The equivalent source distribution on a horizontal surface is determined iteratively through forward calculation of the anomaly on the topographic surface. Convergence of the solution is stable and rapid. The accuracy of the Fourier‐based approach is demonstrated by two synthetic examples. For the gravity example, the rms error between the corrected anomaly and the desired anomaly is 0.01 mGal, which is less than 0.5 percent of the maximum synthetic anomaly. For the magnetic example, the rms error is 0.7 nT, which is less than 1 percent of the maximum synthetic anomaly. The efficiency of the approach is shown by application to the gravity and aeromagnetic grids for Kansas. For gravity data, with a maximum elevation change of 500 m reducing to a horizontal datum results in a maximum correction in gravity anomaly amplitude of up to 2.6 mGal. For aeromagnetic data, the method results in a maximum horizontal shift of anomalies of 470 m with a maximum correction in aeromagnetic anomaly amplitudes up to 270 nT.",10.1190/1.1443434
Ground‐Penetrating Radar: Wave Theory And Numerical Simulation In Lossy Anisotropic Media,"Subsurface georadar is a high‐resolution technique based on the propagation of high‐frequency radio waves. Modeling radio waves in a realistic medium requires the simulation of the complete wavefield and the correct description of the petrophysical properties, such as conductivity and dielectric relaxation. Here, the theory is developed for 2-D transverse magnetic (TM) waves, with a different relaxation function associated to each principal permittivity and conductivity component. In this way, the wave characteristics (e.g., wavefront and attenuation) are anisotropic and have a general frequency dependence. These characteristics are investigated through a plane‐wave analysis that gives the expressions of measurable quantities such as the quality factor and the energy velocity. The numerical solution for arbitrary heterogeneous media is obtained by a grid method that uses a time‐splitting algorithm to circumvent the stiffness of the differential equations. The modeling correctly reproduces the amplitude and the wavefront shape predicted by the plane‐wave analysis for homogeneous media, confirming, in this way, both the theoretical analysis and the numerical algorithm. Finally, the modeling is applied to the evaluation of the electromagnetic response of contaminant pools in a sand aquifer. The results indicate the degree of resolution (radar frequency) necessary to identify the pools and the differences between the anisotropic and isotropic radargrams versus the source‐receiver distance.",10.1190/1.1444085
"Permeability Models Of Porous Media: Characteristic Length Scales, Scaling Constants And Time-Dependent Electrokinetic Coupling","Fluid permeability is one of the most important characteristics of a hydrocarbon reservoir, and is described by a number of empirical and theoretical models. We have taken four of the most important models, each of which is derived from a different physical approach, and have rewritten them in a generic form that implies a characteristic scale length and scaling constant for each model. The four models have been compared theoretically and using experimental data from 22 bead packs and 188 rock cores from a sand-shale sequence in the U. K. sector of the North Sea. The Kozeny-Carman model did not perform well because it takes no account of the connectedness of the pore network and should no longer be used. The other three models (Schwartz, Sen, and Johnson [SSJ]; Katz and Thompson [KT]; and the Revil, Glover, Pezard, and Zamora [RGPZ]) all performed well when used with their respective length scales and scaling constants. Surprisingly,we found that the SSJ and KT models are extremely similar,such that their characteristic scale lengths and scaling constants are almost identical even though they are derived using extremely different approaches: The SSJ model by weighting the Kozeny-Carman model using the local electrical field, and the KT model by using entry radii from fluid imbibition measurements. The experimentally determined scaling constants for each model were found to be    cSSJ ≈ cKT ≈8∕3≈ cRGPZ ∕3  . Use of these models with AC electrokinetic theory has also allowed us to show that these scaling constants are also related to the  a  value in the RGPZ model and the  m*  value in time-dependent electrokinetic theory and then to derive a relationship between the electrokinetic transition frequency and the RGPZ scale length, which we have validated using experimental data. The practical implication of this work for permeability prediction is that the KT model should be used when fluid imbibition data are available, whereas the RGPZ model should be used when electrical data are available.",10.1190/1.3506561
Subsurface Radar Propagation Deconvolution,"The frequency dependence of attenuation is typically far greater for subsurface radar waves than for seismic waves. Since this frequency dependence causes the subsurface radar pulse shape to change as it propagates through the earth, conventional wavelet deconvolution techniques are often inadequate to reconstruct the earth's reflectivity series. The application of a time‐variant filter that undoes the effect of frequency‐dependent attenuation can substantially improve the resolution of subsurface radar data. This filter is minimum‐phase with amplitude characteristics equal to the inverse of the attenuation function of the medium investigated. Preliminary tests on data from surveys over a water tank, an underground mine stope, and fractured granite suggest that good results can also be achieved by assuming attenuation is linearly proportional to frequency, similar to a constant Q model.",10.1190/1.1443583
Seismic Data Compression Methods,"This paper discusses two ways of compressing seismic data prior to long‐distance transmission for display. A Walsh transform technique and an analogous time‐domain method eliminate redundant seismic information allowing data sets to be compressed with little visual degradation. The basic approach consists of using an average 3-bit code to describe data in such a way as to minimize information loss; the method also uses the Walsh transform to achieve further compaction through sequency bandlimiting. A second technique is entirely a time‐domain operation and does not use transforms. The Walsh method, however, produces larger compression ratios than the time technique before serious image degradation occurs. Both schemes have six basic parts: bandlimiting, quantization, encoding, decoding, interpolation, and band‐pass filtering; they differ only in band limiting and interpolation. Band limiting sequencies in the Walsh domain is very similar to, but not the same as, alias filtering and resampling in time. Reducing Walsh bandwidths by some power of two has a time‐domain implementation consisting of an averaging procedure with subsequent resampling, while the inverse Walsh transform step can be viewed as a means of interpolating in the time domain. The convergence properties of three Rademacher derived transforms—Hadamard, Paley, and Walsh—are studied with regard to exploration seismic data. Hadamard energy has been found to be uniformly distributed over its entire spectrum, whereas Walsh and Paley transforms concentrate about 80 percent of the total energy into a major lobe occupying about 15 percent of the total bandwidth (2 msec sampling). Smaller minor lobes containing the remaining 20 percent are discarded while bandlimiting. The major lobe energy suffices for many seismic applications such as VA/VD plot displays. Optimum quantization and encoding of major lobe energy results in an overall 28:1 compression factor for 12 bit data sampled every 2 msec. Analogous time domain compression, on the other hand, only achieves a 16:1 reduction because of the power of two restriction imposed by the resampling and averaging process.",10.1190/1.1440443
Interferometric Correlogram-Space Analysis,"Controlled-source seismic interferometry is a method of obtaining a virtual shot gather from a collection of physical shot gathers. The set of traces corresponding to two common receiver gathers from many physical shots is used to synthesize a virtual shot located at one of the receivers and a receiver at the other. An estimate of the Green's function between these two receivers is obtained by first crosscorrelating corresponding pairs of traces from each of the shots and then stacking the resulting crosscorrelograms. We studied the structure of crosscorrelograms obtained from a VSP acquisition geometry using surface sources and downhole receivers. The model is purely acoustic and contains flat or dipping layers and/or point inclusions that act as diffractors. We propose a semblance analysis based on moveout curves for both point diffractors and flat or dipping layers, which can be used to improve the quality of redatumed traces either by rejecting certain events prior to stacking or by enhancing them.",10.1190/1.3519875
Pole‐And‐Zero Design Of Digital Filters,"A recent paper in Geophysics by Shanks (1967) provides an excellent introduction to recursive or feedback digital filters. These filters do not appear to have been widely used in geophysics; for example, a recent review paper on the use of digital filters in geophysics (Kertz, 1965) does not mention them. The topic takes on added interest with the recent appearance of several papers following the original paper of Dean (1958), applying digital filter concepts to the analysis of gravity and magnetic data.",10.1190/1.1439935
Multiscattering Illumination In Blended Acquisition,"In traditional seismic surveys, the firing time between shots is such that the shot records do not interfere in time. However, in the concept of blended acquisition, the records do overlap, allowing denser source sampling and wider azimuths in an economic way. A denser shot sampling and wider azimuths make that each subsurface gridpoint is illuminated from a larger number of angles and will therefore improve the image quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution. We show that — even with very simple blending parameters like time delays — the incident wavefield at a specific subsurface gridpoint represents a dispersed time series with a ""complex code"". For shot-record migration purposes, this time series must have a stable inverse. In a next step, we show that the illumination can be further improved by utilizing the surface-related multiples. This means that these multiples can be exploited to improve the incident wavefield by filling angle gaps in the illumination and/or by extending the range of angles. In this way, the energy contained in the multiples now contributes to the image, rather than decreasing its quality. One remarkable consequence of this property is that the benefits to be obtained from the improved illumination depend on the detector locations in acquisition geometries as well. We show how to quantify the contribution of the blended surface multiples to the illuminating wavefield for a blended source configuration. Results confirm that the combination of blending and multiple scattering increases the illumination energy and, therefore, will improve the quality of shot-record migration results beyond today's capability.",10.1190/geo2011-0121.1
Solid Viscosity Of Fluid-Saturated Porous Rock With Squirt Flows At Seismic Frequencies,"We have developed a macroscopic model for a two-phase medium (solid porous rock frame plus saturating pore fluid) with squirt flows based on Lagrangian continuum mechanics. The model focuses on improved physics of rock deformation, including explicit differential equations in time domain, causality, linearity, frequency-independent parameters with clear physical meanings, and an absence of mathematical internal or memory variables. The approach shows that all existing squirt-flow models can be viewed as microscopic models of viscosity for solid rock. As in existing models, the pore space is differentiated into compliant and relatively stiff pores. At lower frequencies, the effects of fluid flows within compliant pores are described by bulk and shear solid viscosities of the effective porous frame. Squirt-flow effects are ""Biot consistent,"" which means that there exists a viscous coupling between the rock frame and the fluid in stiff pores. Biot's poroelastic effects associated with stiff porosity and global flows are also fully included in the model. Comparisons with several squirt-flow models show good agreement in predicting wave attenuation to approximately 1 kHz frequencies. The squirt-flow viscosity for sandstone is estimated in the range of 106-108  cP, which is close to field observations. Because of its origins in rigorous mechanics, the model can be used to describe any wavelike and transient deformations of heterogeneous porous media or finite bodies encountered in many field and laboratory experiments. The model also leads to new numerical algorithms for wavefield modeling, which are illustrated by 1D finite-difference waveform modeling.",10.1190/geo2015-0406.1
Low‐Frequency Radiation From Point Sources In A Fluid‐Filled Borehole,"Far‐field displacement fields have been derived for an impulsive point force acting on a fluid‐filled borehole wall under the assumption that the borehole diameter is small compared to the wavelength involved. The displacements due to an arbitrary source can be computed easily by combining the solutions for the impulsive sources. In general, the borehole source generates not only longitudinal and vertically polarized shear waves, but also horizontally polarized shear waves. This study also indicates that only the axisymmetric motion around the borehole due to normal stress is affected by the fluid in the borehole. In the long‐wavelength limit, the presence of the fluid does not affect the radiation from tangential sources into the surrounding medium.",10.1190/1.1442226
Application Of Unsplit Convolutional Perfectly Matched Layer For Scalar Arbitrarily Wide-Angle Wave Equation,"A classical split perfectly matched layer (PML) method has recently been applied to the scalar arbitrarily wide-angle wave equation (AWWE) in terms of displacement. However, the classical split PML obviously increases computational cost and cannot efficiently absorb waves propagating into the absorbing layer at grazing incidence. Our goal was to improve the computational efficiency of AWWE and to enhance the suppression of edge reflections by applying a convolutional PML (CPML). We reformulated the original AWWE as a first-order formulation and incorporated the CPML with a general complex frequency shifted stretching operator into the renewed formulation. A staggered-grid finite-difference (FD) method was adopted to discretize the first-order equation system. For wavefield depth continuation, the first-order AWWE with the CPML saved memory compared with the original second-order AWWE with the conventional split PML. With the help of numerical examples, we verified the correctness of the staggered-grid FD method and concluded that the CPML can efficiently absorb evanescent and propagating waves.",10.1190/geo2014-0103.1
Nmo‐Velocity Surfaces And Dix‐Type Formulas In Anisotropic Heterogeneous Media,"Application of the Dix‐type averaging to layered transversely isotropic media with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI) shows that the presence of dipping interfaces above the reflector makes the P‐wave NMO ellipse dependent on the vertical velocity and anisotropic coefficients ε and δ. In contrast, P‐wave moveout in VTI models with a horizontally layered overburden is fully controlled by the NMO velocity of horizontal events and the Alkhalifah‐Tsvankin coefficient η ≈ ε − δ. Hence, in some laterally heterogeneous, layered VTI models P‐wave reflection data may provide enough information for anisotropic depth processing.",10.1190/1.1484536
Lacoste And Romberg Stabilized Platform Shipboard Gravity Meter,"The LaCoste and Romberg gravity meter designed for operation in gimbals was redesigned for satisfactory stabilized platform operation and a suitable stabilized platform was made. A major modification of the gravity meter was redesign of the suspension to more nearly restrict motion to a single degree of freedom. Errors due to cross coupling between horizontal and vertical accelerations and an unsuspected type of cross coupling due to gravity meter imperfections are important but correctable. The stabilized platform gravity meter has been tested at sea. Compared to the gimbal type of gravity meter, it is simpler to operate; it will operate in rough weather; and it is considerably more accurate.",10.1190/1.1439860
Effects Of Pore Structure And Wettability On The Electrical Resistivity Of Partially Saturated Rocks—A Network Study,"A network model of porous media is used to assess the effects of pore structure and matrix wettability on the resistivity of partially saturated rocks. Our focus is the magnitude of the saturation exponent n from Archie's law and the hysteresis in resistivity between drainage and imbibition cycles. Wettability is found to have the dominant effect on resistivity. The network model is used to investigate the role of a wetting film in water‐wet systems, and the behavior of oil‐wet systems. In the presence of a thin wetting film in water‐wet systems, the observed variation in n with saturation is reduced significantly resulting in lower n values and reduced hysteresis. This is attributed to the electrical continuity provided by the film at low‐water saturation between otherwise physically isolated portions of water. Oil‐wet systems, when compared with the water‐wet systems, are found to have higher n values. In addition, the oil‐wet systems exhibit a different form of hysteresis and more pronounced hysteresis. These differences in the resistivity response are attributed to differences in the pore scale distribution of water. The effects of pore structure are assessed by varying pore size distribution and standard deviation of the pore size distribution and considering networks with pore size correlation. The most significant parameter is found to be the pore size correlation. When the sizes of the neighboring pores of the network are correlated positively, the magnitude of n and hysteresis are reduced substantially in both the water‐wet and oil‐wet systems. This is attributed to higher pore accessibility in the correlated networks. The results of the present study emphasize the importance of conducting laboratory measurements on core samples with reservoir fluids and wettability that is representative of the reservoir. Hysteresis in resistivity can be present, particularly in oil‐wet systems, and should be considered in the interpretation of resistivity data.",10.1190/1.1444216
"Discussion Of ""An Evaluation Of Basement Depth Determination From Airborne Magnetometer Data"" By Peter Jacobsen, Jr.","Mr. Jacobsen's article and the accompanying discussions on the scope and outlook for the current interpretational practices in aeromagnetic surveys are very timely and deserve the attention of all geophysicists as well as exploration management. Since World War II the aeromagnetic surveys have replaced the ground magnetic surveys as a reconnaissance exploration tool chiefly because of the former's rapidity and cheapness in data‐gathering. In this process, however, the aerial technique has lost one advantage going with the ground surveys. In land surveys the practice has been to make simultaneous magnetic and gravity observations and the interpretations of basement features are made from these paired observations. I believe that the absence of concurrent information on gravity has been a real handicap with aeromagnetic interpretation in reliably locating basement features in the early stages of exploration. Perhaps the present aerial gravitymeter instrumentation can be soon improved to desired sensitivity for exploration so that simultaneous gravity‐magnetic observations from the air will be possible. In large unexplored sedimentary areas the gravity data are as valuable, sometimes more, to the interpretation of magnetic data as a knowledge of the magnetic properties of any out‐cropping rocks.",10.1190/1.1438969
Shear Velocity Logging In Slow Formations Using The Stoneley Wave,"We apply an iterative, linearized inversion method to Stoneley waves recorded on acoustic logs in a borehole. Our objective is to assess inversion of Stoneley wave phase and group velocity as a practical technique for shear velocity logging in slow formations. Indirect techniques for shear logging are of particular importance in this case because there is no shear head wave arrival. Acoustic logs from a long‐spaced sonic tool provided high‐quality, low‐noise data in the 1 to 10 kHz band for this experiment. A shear velocity profile estimated by inversion of a 60 ft (18 ⋅ 3 m) section of full‐wave acoustic data correlates well with the P‐wave log for the section. The inferred shear velocity ranges from 60 to 90 percent of the sound velocity of the fluid. Formal error estimates on the shear velocity are everywhere less than 5 percent. Moreover, application of the same inversion method to synthetic waveforms corroborates these error estimates. Finally, a synthetic acoustic waveform computed from inversion results is an excellent match to the observed waveform. On the basis of these results, we conclude that Stoneley‐wave inversion constitutes a practical, indirect, shear‐logging technique for slow formations. Success of the shear‐logging method depends upon availability of high‐quality, low‐noise waveform data in the 1 to 4 kHz band. Given good prior estimates of compressional velocity and density of the borehole fluid, only rough estimates of borehole radius and formation density and compressional velocity are required. The existing inversion procedure also yields estimates of formation Q inferred from spectral amplitudes of Stoneley waves. This extension of the method is promising, since amplitudes of Stoneley waves in a slow formation are highly sensitive to formation Q. Attenuation caused by formation Q dominates over attenuation caused by fluid viscosity if the viscosity is less than about 0.1N⋅s/m2. However, Stoneley‐wave amplitudes are also sensitive to gradients in shear velocity in the direction of propagation. In some cases, correction for the effects of shear‐velocity gradients is required to obtain the formation Q from Stoneley‐wave attenuation.",10.1190/1.1442027
Making Geophysics Meaningful To Geologists,"This has been a problem in the past, just as the converse has also. Communications barriers, however, are fading away, because at each level, educational, corporate divisional, and in operations, geologists are becoming better geophysicists and geophysicists are becoming better geologists. Their formerly discrete endeavors are becoming better coordinated and their work less separate. Geophysicists have been largely concerned with measurements of earth‐crust phenomena. Incorporation of more geology into such measurements has increased the reliability of the conclusions. As knowledge of the earth increases, the application of geology becomes less of an intuitive matter and thus more precise also. In this epoch in which oil and gas exploration proceeds to progressively greater depths, the distinction between a petroleum geologist and a petroleum geophysicist becomes more difficult to define. The time appears to be approaching when universities aiming graduates at the petroleum industry may graduate petroleum earth scientists, not geologists and geophysicists.",10.1190/1.1439457
Simplification Of Tidal Corrections For Gravity Meter Surveys,"Recent papers have called attention to the considerable effect of lunar and solar tidal forces on the vertical component of gravity but have given no instructions for the computation of this effect. Material published in English on this subject, so far as the author has been able to discover, does not present a rapid, practical method of computation which could be used economically as a matter of routine in gravimeter work. In this paper he attempts to analyze the degree of accuracy required in these computations, and develops a chart from which the tidal correction for any gravimeter obervation in the United States can be obtained directly in less than a minute with an average error of less than 0.01 milligal.",10.1190/1.1444991
Inversion Of Low-Induction Number Conductivity Meter Data To Predict Seasonal Saturation Variation,"Our research introduced a method to monitor saturation in the near surface. In agricultural settings, methods measuring electrical conductivity can provide useful information about soil type, moisture content, and salinity extent. Electrical conductivity meters have been used in a number of studies to determine soil properties in a qualitative sense. We examined the range of structures in which the use of low-induction number instruments can be used successfully to determine layered-earth electrical conductivity. We used an inversion routine which employs a Bayesian modification to the ridge-regression technique with a priori conductivity assumptions typical of agricultural areas. We performed joint inversion of horizontal and vertical dipole configurations at two coil separations for layer over half-space models with electrical properties of silt, loam, clay, and saline waters. Generally, the inversion code resolved layer thickness to better than 25% and electrical conductivity to better than 20% if the layer is less than 3-m thick. We then inverted field measurements acquired in salt-scalded areas in the Yass River Valley, New South Wales, Australia, to determine a layer over a half-space. With Kennedy's formulation concerning the relationship between porosity, water saturation and electrical conductivity, we used the field results to predict autumn water saturation for the top layer to be 13% and the bottom layer to be 15%. In the spring, we used the field results to predict saturation of 50% for the top layer and 51% for the bottom layer, leading to a seasonal variation in soil saturation of approximately 36%. Predicted saturation was spatially consistent across the traverse line, suggesting that the developed methodology was successful.",10.1190/geo2010-0378.1
Application Of A New 2D Time-Domain Full-Waveform Inversion Scheme To Crosshole Radar Data,"Crosshole radar tomography is a useful tool in diverse investigations in geology, hydrogeology, and engineering. Conventional tomograms provided by standard ray-based techniques have limited resolution, primarily because only a fraction of the information contained in the radar data (i.e., the first-arrival times and maximum first-cycle amplitudes) is included in the inversion. To increase the resolution of radar tomograms, we have developed a versatile full-waveform inversion scheme that is based on a finite-difference time-domain solution of Maxwell's equations. This scheme largely accounts for the 3D nature of radar-wave propagation and includes an efficient method for extracting the source wavelet from the radar data. After demonstrating the potential of the new scheme on two realistic synthetic data sets, we apply it to two crosshole field data sets acquired in very different geologic/hydrogeologic environments. These are the first applications of full-waveform tomography to observed crosshole radar data. The resolution of all full-waveform tomograms is shown to be markedly superior to that of the associated ray tomograms. Small subsurface features a fraction of the dominant radar wavelength and boundaries between distinct geological/hydrological units are sharply imaged in the full-waveform tomograms.",10.1190/1.2761848
A Fast Algorithm For Sparse Multichannel Blind Deconvolution,"We have addressed blind deconvolution in a multichannel framework. Recently, a robust solution to this problem based on a Bayesian approach called sparse multichannel blind deconvolution (SMBD) was proposed in the literature with interesting results. However, its computational complexity can be high. We have proposed a fast algorithm based on the minimum entropy deconvolution, which is considerably less expensive. We designed the deconvolution filter to minimize a normalized version of the hybrid l1/l2-norm loss function. This is in contrast to the SMBD, in which the hybrid l1/l2-norm function is used as a regularization term to directly determine the deconvolved signal. Results with synthetic data determined that the performance of the obtained deconvolution filter was similar to the one obtained in a supervised framework. Similar results were also obtained in a real marine data set for both techniques.",10.1190/geo2015-0069.1
"Kirchhoff Modeling, Inversion For Reflectivity, And Subsurface Illumination","Because of its computational efficiency, prestack Kirchhoff depth migration is currently one of the most popular algorithms used in 2-D and 3-D subsurface depth imaging. Nevertheless, Kirchhoff algorithms in their typical implementation produce less than ideal results in complex terranes where multipathing from the surface to a given image point may occur, and beneath fast carbonates, salt, or volcanics through which ray‐theoretical energy cannot penetrate to illuminate underlying slower‐velocity sediments. To evaluate the likely effectiveness of a proposed seismic‐acquisition program, we could perform a forward‐modeling study, but this can be expensive. We show how Kirchhoff modeling can be defined as the mathematical transpose of Kirchhoff migration. The resulting Kirchhoff modeling algorithm has the same low computational cost as Kirchhoff migration and, unlike expensive full acoustic or elastic wave‐equation methods, only models the events that Kirchhoff migration can image. Kirchhoff modeling is also a necessary element of constrained least‐squares Kirchhoff migration. We show how including a simple a priori constraint during the inversion (that adjacent common‐offset images should be similar) can greatly improve the resulting image by partially compensating for irregularities in surface sampling (including missing data), as well as for irregularities in ray coverage due to strong lateral variations in velocity and our failure to account for multipathing. By allowing unstacked common‐offset gathers to become interpretable, the additional cost of constrained least‐squares migration may be justifiable for velocity analysis and amplitude‐variation‐with‐offset studies. One useful by‐product of least‐squares migration is an image of the subsurface illumination for each offset. If the data are sufficiently well sampled (so that including the constraint term is not necessary), the illumination can instead be calculated directly and used to balance the result of conventional migration, obtaining most of the advantages of least‐squares migration for only about twice the cost of conventional migration.",10.1190/1.1444812
The Correlation Refraction Method Of Seismic Surveying,"This paper presents a method of refraction shooting which has been developed to solve the problem of obtaining seismic data in the Edwards Plateau region of West Texas. The results of an experimental survey in the Todd Area, Crockett County, Texas, are shown to illustrate the method.",10.1190/1.1437214
Cooperative Joint Inversion Of 3D Seismic And Magnetotelluric Data: With Application In A Mineral Province,"The integration of different geophysical data has the potential to provide more accurate estimate of subsurface rock properties. Several methodologies and attempts have been developed over the years with the objective of reducing exploration risk. We have developed a cooperative joint-inversion approach intended to facilitate recovery of acoustic impedance (AI) using seismic and magnetotelluric (MT) data. In this approach, the MT data provided a pathway for iteratively building large-scale low-frequency information content not directly recoverable from the seismic data themselves. The MT data provided complementary information to seismic, especially in seismically complex terrains such as overthrust belts, subbasalt and subsalt, carbonate reefs or for targets below deep cover containing limestone, concretionary layers, or basalt. On the other hand, the seismic data provided structural information necessary to derive accurate resistivity models from MT inversion and small-scale features during seismic impedance inversion. The connections between resistivity and the elastic property of rocks are obtained from petrophysical relationships derived from available borehole data, or if not available, from empirical relationships. We tested our technique on synthetic and field data. The application of cooperative joint inversion to 3D seismic and MT data sets acquired in a mineral province made it possible to recover AI distribution across a wide range of geologic environments. The resulting rock property images provided a direct link to geology that is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to extract from the individual data sets.",10.1190/geo2014-0252.1
Identification Of Image Artifacts From Internal Multiples,"First-order internal multiples are a source of coherent noise in seismic images because they do not satisfy the single-scattering assumption fundamental to most seismic processing. There are a number of techniques to estimate internal multiples in data; in many cases, these algorithms leave some residual multiple energy in the data. This energy produces artifacts in the image, and the location of these artifacts is unknown because the multiples were estimated in the data before the image was formed. To avoid this problem, we propose a method by which the artifacts caused by internal multiples are estimated directly in the image. We use ideas from the generalized Bremmer series and the Lippmann-Schwinger scattering series to create a forward-scattering series to model multiples and an inverse-scattering series to describethe impact these multiples have on the common-image gather and the image. We present an algorithm that implements the third term of this series, responsible for the formation of first-order in-ternal multiples. The algorithm works as part of a wave-equation migration; the multiple estimation is made at each depth using a technique related to one used to estimate surface-related multi-ples. This method requires knowledge of the velocity model to the depth of the shallowest reflector involved in the generation of the multiple of interest. This information allows us to estimate internal multiples without assumptions inherent to other methods. In particular, we account for the formation of caustics. Results of the techniques on synthetic data illustrate the kinematic accuracy of predicted multiples, and results on field data illustrate the potential of estimating artifacts caused by internal multiples in the image rather than in the data.",10.1190/1.2434780
Differential Geomagnetic Sounding,"Local differences of the horizontal components of transient geomagnetic variations have been recorded by using sensitive variometers associated with a telemetric link. Instead of studying a relation between the variations of the vertical anomalous components and horizontal normal ones, we have studied in the time domain, the spatial distribution of the quantities: ΔHoi(t)=Hi(t)-Ho(t) and ΔDoi(t)=Di(t)-Do(t), which represent the differences between the horizontal components of the transient field at station i and at station o chosen as the reference station. These differences can be interpreted, in every station, as the components of a horizontal anomalous field which has interesting properties: It has a purely internal origin. Its direction in space remains constant. In its expression, time and space variables are naturally separated. The devices that we use allow us to determine the modulus and the direction of the anomalous field in real time without any scattering. The properties of the anomalous field are found to be incompatible with the hypothesis of a local induction in a conductive structure, but can easily be explained by a current concentration in a conductive structure.",10.1190/1.1440715
Test-Site Calibration And Validation Of Airborne And Ground-Based Tem Systems,"Validation and calibration of airborne and ground-based time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) systems are important to obtain high-quality data and thereby reliable and reproducible results. Validation and calibration become even more important when the TEM systems are to be used for low-anomaly groundwater and environmental applications. The recent extension of the Danish TEM test site has made it possible to perform detailed validation of airborne TEM systems and calibrate airborne TEM systems that cannot make hovering measurements. We evaluated the Danish TEM test site and used a test site calibration scheme recommended for ground-based as well as airborne TEM systems. Furthermore, we discovered an extended data set from the airborne TEM system, SkyTEM, from the test site, used for an extensive validation of the SkyTEM system. This validation included repeatability tests at different heights and comparisons with the reference sections obtained with ground-based measurements. The validation and comparison were performed directly on the inversion results and in data space, down to the single data gate values. The extensive validation of the SkyTEM system at the TEM test site revealed a very stable and reliable system. The data repeatability of the SkyTEM system at different heights and directions was, in general, well within the standard deviation (STD) of the data. The agreement between the ground-based reference model sections and the SkyTEM model section from different recording heights was very good. Likewise, the match between the ground-based reference data and the SkyTEM data was good and, in general, within 1.5 times the STD on the data. The positive outcome of the extensive validation also confirmed that data processing and modeling were performed at the highest standard.",10.1190/geo2012-0244.1
2-D Resistivity Modeling: An Approach To Arrays Parallel To The Strike Direction,"An algorithm for two‐dimensional electrical resistivity modeling using the finite‐element method with mixed boundary conditions can calculate the electrical potential along any arbitrary direction. In the particular case of the direction parallel to the strike of the structure, a numerical singularity occurs. We resolved it by calculating the potential near the singularity and improving the involved interpolation of the transformed potential. Investigating the shape of potential in the Fourier transformed space, we conclude that this interpolation may combine logarithmic and exponential functions.",10.1190/1.1443127
Depth Of Investigation In Electromagnetic Sounding Methods,"The time or frequency at which the electromagnetic (EM) response of a buried inhomogeneity can first be measured is determined by its depth of burial and the average conductivity of the overlying section; it is relatively independent of the type of source or receiver and their separation. The ability to make measurements at this time or frequency, however, depends on the sensitivity and accuracy of the instrumentation, the signal strength, and the ambient noise level. These factors affect different EM sounding systems in surprisingly different ways. For the magnetotelluric (MT) method, it is possible to detect a buried half‐space under about 1.5 skin depths of overburden. The maximum depth of investigation is virtually unbounded because of high signal strengths at low frequencies. Transient electromagnetic (TEM) soundings, on the other hand, have a limited depth of penetration, but are less affected by static shift errors. For TEM, a buried inhomogeneity can be detected under about one diffusion depth of overburden. For conventional near‐zone sounding in which induced voltage is measured (impulse response), the depth of investigation is proportional to the 15 power of the source moment and ground resistivity. By contrast, if the receiver is a magnetometer (step response system), the depth of investigation is proportional to the 13 power of source moment and is no longer a function of resistivity. Magnetic‐field measurements may, therefore, be superior for exploration in conductive areas such as sedimentary basins. Far‐zone, or long‐offset, TEM soundings are traditionally used for deep exploration. The depth of investigation for a voltage receiver is proportional to the 14 power of source moment and resistivity and is inversely proportional to the source‐receiver separation. Magnetic‐field measurements are difficult to make at long offsets because instrumental accuracy limits the measurement of the very slow decay of the magnetic field. Frequency‐domain controlled‐source systems are ideally suited for sounding at the very shallow depths needed for engineering, archaeological, and groundwater applications because of the relative ease of extending the measurements to arbitrarily high frequencies, and also because geometric soundings can be made at low induction numbers.",10.1190/1.1442716
Comparison Of Kirchhoff And Reverse‐Time Migration Methods With Applications To Prestack Depth Imaging Of Complex Structures,"The performance of two popular migration methods—the Kirchhoff integral and reverse‐time migrations—is evaluated through applications to imaging complex structures using prestack shot records. The migration results from the Marmousi model data demonstrate that reverse‐time migration is more accurate than Kirchhoff migration in imaging the steeply dipping faults. However, the improved accuracy of reverse‐time migration requires higher computational costs. In the application to the Alberta Foothills data where a good estimate of the velocity model is available, however, both the Kirchhoff and the reverse‐time migration methods produce almost identical results. This implies that in the real world of exploration seismology, it will be relatively difficult to identify which method performs better because we never know the exact answer of the subsurface.",10.1190/1.1444416
Pc‐Based Acquisition And Processing Of High‐Resolution Marine Seismic Data,"We have improved the quality of high‐resolution marine seismic data using a simple PC‐based acquisition and processing system. The system consists of a PC, an A/D converter, and a magneto‐optical disk drive. The system has been designed to acquire single‐channel data at up to 60,000 samples per second and to perform data processing of seismic data by a simple procedure. Test surveys have been carried out off Pohang, southern East Sea of Korea. The seismic systems used for the test were an air gun and a 3.5 kHz sub‐bottom profiling system. Spectral characteristics of the sources were analyzed. Simple digital signal processes which include gain recovery, deconvolution, band‐pass filter, and swell filter were performed. The quality of seismic sections produced by the system is greatly enhanced in comparison to analog sections. The PC‐based system for acquisition and processing of high‐resolution marine seismic data is economical and versatile.",10.1190/1.1444096
Mutual Electromagnetic Coupling Of Loops Over A Homogeneous Ground,Computations are presented for the mutual impedance between small wire loops situated on or over a semi‐infinite conductor. The results have application to electromagnetic methods of geophysical exploration.,10.1190/1.1438167
Induced Polarization In Disseminated Sulfide Ores Containing Elongated Mineralization,"A disseminated sulfide ore is represented by a two‐component system in which metallically conducting prolate spheroidal particles (simulating elongated mineralization) are randomly scattered throughout an electrolytic host. The Helmholtz equations describing the spatial and frequency dependence of anions and cations in the electrolyte near the surface of a particle are solved in prolate spheroidal coordinates. Expressions for the frequency‐dependent dipole moment induced on the particle by external electric fields transverse or parallel to the long axis of the particle are found by examining boundary conditions related to electrochemical charge transfer between the metallic particle and the electrolyte. The dipole moments of individual particles can be used to determine the effective conductivity spectrum of the mixture as a whole via the simple Maxwell formula or a novel recursive calculation which is accurate for large‐volume fractions of particles. Examples of conductivity spectra from this electrochemical model incorporating elongated particles are presented, and comparison of results with appropriate experimental data indicates good agreement.",10.1190/1.1441264
Propagation Of Radio Waves Over A Stratified Ground,"The propagation of vertically polarized radio waves over a horizontally stratified medium is investigated. A general expression for the ""wave tilt"" is derived for the case of any number of layers with arbitrary properties in each layer. Numerical calculations are carried out for the special case of only two layers which show that the conductivity and dielectric constant variations of the lower layers will affect the magnitude and phase of the wave tilt.",10.1190/1.1437893
Three‐Dimensional Migration Of Swath Surveys,"A three‐dimensional (3-D) wave‐equation migration program is used to migrate swath data (swath data are here defined as a very narrow 3-D survey consisting of approximately ten seismic lines and having a width of about 500 m). Three‐dimensionally migrated swath data give an accurate 3-D image of the subsurface and have a higher signal‐to‐noise ratio than 2-D data. These advantages are gained at the expense of lateral resolution in the crossline direction and less extensive 3-D subsurface coverage. Since swaths are on the order of one‐tenth the size of a normal 3-D survey, the costs of gathering and processing swath data are about 10 percent those of a conventional 3-D survey. Thus 3-D migrated swath surveys are a practical means of producing 3-D images in areas where the expense of conventional 3-D surveys is not justified. Following 3-D wave‐equation migration, inlines from the swath data are geologically interpretable. However, crosslines from the swath data are dominated by migration artifacts (often called migration smiles), making them uninterpretable. Relatively high‐amplitude portions of these migration smiles indicate where the data were accurately migrated. These facts lead to a two‐step method of interpreting 3-D migrated swath data. First the inlines are interpreted geologically, then the accuracy of that interpretation is verified by tying it to the crossline data.",10.1190/1.1442941
Computer Data Processing And Quantitative Interpretation Of Airborne Resistivity Surveys,"The recently constructed airborne electromagnetic system called E-Phase measures the intensity of the vertical and horizontal electric fields. Standard broadcasting, VLF, and LF navigation aid transmitters are used as sources of the primary EM field. A system of this kind responds best to horizontal layers of large extent and therefore is suitable for geologic mapping and for the detection of resistive materials such as gravel and permafrost. A successful application of the system would not have been possible without digital recording of the data and subsequent computer processing. An efficient algorithm consisting of three processing steps assures low processing cost and provides for two intermediate data checks. Final outputs are printer plots of apparent resistivity for all flight lines and maps of stacked profiles or contours. Quantitative interpretation was made possible by the simultaneous recording of the data at three transmitter frequencies and by the availability of theoretical solutions for layered media. Instead of generating an atlas of type curves, an interactive program was written which enables the geophysicist to rapidly obtain apparent resistivities assuming a three‐layer model. A close match with the measured data is easy to achieve when a reasonable estimate of two of the parameters (resistivities, thicknesses) can be made initially. The interpretation procedure is demonstrated on a case history, a 1973 survey conducted near Wadena, Saskatchewan.",10.1190/1.1440570
Volumetric Wavefield Recording And Wave Equation Inversion For Near‐Surface Material Properties,"The quantities estimated are the effective velocities of the P‐ and S‐components experienced by the wavefield at any point in time. Hence, the velocity estimates may vary with both wave type and wavelength. The estimates may be useful to aid statics estimation and are exactly the effective velocities required for separation of the wavefield into P‐ and S‐, and up‐ and down‐going components.",10.1190/1.1512751
A Downhole Magnetometric Resistivity Technique For Electrical Sounding Beneath A Conductive Surface Layer,"The magnetometric resistivity (MMR) method has not been used systematically for vertical electrical sounding because surficial measurements of the magnetic field caused by static current flow from a point source of current at the surface are independent of the form of the variation of earth resistivity with depth. However, data obtained from an adaptation of the MMR method in which the ratio of the magnetic fields below and above a known conductive surface layer is measured as a function of the horizontal range from the current source can be inverted to obtain the unknown resistivity of deeper material. The practical limitation is that the integrated conductivity of the surface layer must not be much smaller than the integrated conductivity of the unknown zone in order to observe diagnostic ratios significantly different from unity. The expressions derived for the magnetic‐field ratio and for the sensitivity of the ratio to changes in the resistivity of a plane‐layered unknown zone are closed‐form inverse Hankel transforms. The transforms are evaluated analytically for a model of constant, uniform resistivity. One possible geotechnical application of the method is the detection of offshore, resistive permafrost beneath the shallow Beaufort Sea. A theoretical design study in which ratios of the magnetic fields at the bottom and top of the sea are synthesized and the sensitivity of those ratios to changes in sea‐floor resistivity is determined as a function of range and depth, respectively, reveals that the resistivity of a permafrost zone 50 m thick buried 20 m below the sea floor can be identified. The maximum range needed is of the order of 200 m, which appears to be smaller than the maximum spacing required for a Schlumberger sounding to yield similar information.",10.1190/1.1442484
Wave-Equation Migration Velocity Analysis For Vti Models,"Anisotropic models are needed for wave simulation and inversion where a complex geologic environment exists. We extended the theory of wave equation migration velocity analysis to build vertical transverse isotropic models. Because of the ambiguity between depth and δ in the acoustic regime, we assumed δ can be accurately obtained from other sources of information, and inverted for the NMO slowness and the anellipticity parameter η. We combined the differential semblance optimization objective function with the stacking power maximization to evaluate the focusing of the prestack image in the subsurface-offset domain. To regularize the multiparameter inversion, we built a framework to adapt the geologic and the rock physics information to guide the updates in NMO slowness and η. This regularization step was crucial to stabilize the inversion and to produce geologically meaningful results. We tested the proposed approach on a synthetic data set and a 2D Gulf of Mexico data set starting with a fairly good initial anisotropic model. The inversion results revealed shallow anomalies collocated in NMO velocity and η and improved the continuity and the resolution of the final stacked images.",10.1190/geo2013-0338.1
"First Results From Electrical And Seismic Studies Of Low‐Resistivity, Low‐Velocity Material Beneath Eastern Colorado","First results are reported for magnetotelluric (MT) observed apparent resistivities and phases, corresponding to both off‐diagonal components of the 2 by 2 electromagnetic impedance tensor, derived from E and H field recordings near Anton, in the High Plains of eastern Colorado. The data were recorded by a gain ranged, multichannel, multirate digital field system. The results, which span a frequency range of roughly 105:1, extend from about 0.05 sec (20 Hz) to several thousand seconds. Corresponding sets of tightly clustered, practically continuous MT apparent resistivities and phases are virtually identical, constituting strong evidence for lateral homogeneity and isotropy of the electrical conductivity near this site. The derived one‐dimensional resistivity‐depth model is concordant with the depth and thickness of the local water table, with resistivities and depths for the Pierre shale derived from nearby well logs, with reconnaissance audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) data, and with ultra‐long period apparent resistivities derived from regional Deep Geomagnetic Sounding observations. The derived resistivity depth distribution also compares well with the depth to the crystalline basement from the neighboring U.S.G.S. Lamar‐Sterling, Colorado, seismic refraction profile. The concordance, between depths interpreted for a mid‐crustal seismic low‐velocity zone and a corresponding low‐resistivity zone at this site, parallels similar results previously reported for west Texas‐eastern New Mexico, and various sites in the U.S.S.R.",10.1190/1.1440748
The Fluid Factor As An Avo Indicator,"Castagna and Smith (1994) presented a very interesting comparison of some of the different amplitude variation with offset (AVO) indicators used in the industry today. They used a worldwide sample of data to compute their examples. In their paper, they alluded to the ""fluid factor"" of Smith and Gidlow (1987) but they did not compute this attribute for their data. In the following, we suggest how the fluid factor can be computed, and compare the results with the (RP-RS) and (A + B)/2 techniques. We have used Castagna and Smith's (1994) notation.",10.1190/1.1444067
The Practical View In Geophysical Exploration For Metallic Ore Bodies,"This is a nontechnical paper dealing with the potentialities of geophysical methods in the search for metallic ore bodies which do not outcrop. It emphasizes what exploration engineers are entitled to expect as well as to demand from geophysical surveys. Harmful misconceptions and frustrations have arisen among mining men through lack of understanding of the possibilities of the various methods, and through confusion traceable to the loose claims and looser interpretation of results on the part of some geophysical surveyors. The miner should be made to understand that geophysical methods merely measure physical effects, either inherent, or induced, in various rock bodies, and that high geological competence is usually needed to judge whether anomalous measurements may be correlative with ore, likely ore‐bearing structures or with features totally unrelated to ore occurrences. Since they do not put any tags on ore bodies, as some have been led to believe, the capabilities and limitations of the methods need further clarification. The biggest hurdles to overcome before geophysics can reach a fuller measure of its true potentialities in ore finding are, first, the development of techniques for mitigating or eliminating the anomalous effects of overburden; second, development of methods for detection of disseminated metallic sulphide deposits; third, perfection of techniques of investigating the rocks surrounding bore holes for appreciable distances; fourth, the improvement of techniques for geophysical prospecting underground; fifth, independent consultation before a survey is started to weigh dispassionately the chances for success (geophysical surveys should be checked with much pains and precision by repeating traverses and readings); sixth, reduction in costs for all methods; and seventh, modification and improvement in efficiency of equipment with special attention to increasing depth range. Finally, there is a critical need for research, long‐range, indirect, fundamental research, as well as direct research on known ore deposits which have not been disturbed too much by development or mining. This latter will be most profitably carried out if undertaken by private mining companies on their own properties and with complete cooperation from their own geological staffs.",10.1190/1.1437428
Simultaneous Inversion Of Pp And Ps Seismic Data,"Presented at the 71st Annual International Meeting, Society of Exploration Geophysics.",10.1190/1.2194533
Stochastic Inversion Of Facies From Seismic Data Based On Sequential Simulations And Probability Perturbation Method,"We presented a new methodology for seismic reservoir characterization that combined advanced geostatistical methods with traditional geophysical models to provide fine-scale reservoir models of facies and reservoir properties, such as porosity and net-to-gross. The methodology we proposed was a stochastic inversion where we simultaneously obtained earth models of facies, rock properties, and elastic attributes. It is based on an iterative process where we generated a set of models of reservoir properties by using sequential simulations, calculated the corresponding elastic attributes through rock-physics relations, computed synthetic seismograms and, finally, compared these synthetic results with the real seismic amplitudes. The optimization is a stochastic technique, the probability perturbation method, that perturbs the probability distribution of the initial realization and allows obtaining a facies model consistent with all available data through a relatively small number of iterations. The probability perturbation approach uses the Tau model probabillistic method, which provides an analytical representation to combine single probabilistic information into a joint conditional probability. The advantages of probability perturbation method are that it transforms a 3D multiparameter optimization problem into a set of 1D optimization problems and it allowed us to include several probabilistic information through the Tau model. The method was tested on a synthetic case where we generated a set of pseudologs and the corresponding synthetic seismograms. We then applied the method to a real well profile, and finally extended it to a 2D seismic section. The application to the real reservoir study included data from three wells and partially stacked near and far seismic sections, and provided as a main result the set of optimized models of facies, and of the relevant petrophysical properties, to be the initial static reservoir models for fluid flow reservoir simulations.",10.1190/geo2011-0417.1
A Mise‐À‐La‐Masse Study Of The Cavendish Geophysical Test Site,"The mise‐à‐la‐masse method of electrical prospecting is used when a conductive, mineralized zone has already been located. A current electrode is placed directly in the mineralized zone, and the resulting potential field is mapped on the surface or in the subsurface via drill holes or underground openings. The potential field reflects the shape, size, and orientation of the mineral deposit. A field study of this method was carried out at the Cavendish Geophysical Test Site in Ontario, Canada. Two vein‐type mineralized bodies, zone A and zone B, are known to exist at the site. Drill holes were used to implant a current electrode in each of the veins and surface potentials were measured. The extension of the two zones in the strike direction was established with the resulting mise‐à‐la‐masse potential profiles. However, no electrical continuity between zones A and B could be discerned, indicating that the veins are not connected at depth. The dip of zone A appears to be toward the west, contrary to that inferred from the drill hole logs. The measured potentials are influenced by the mutual proximity of the far current and potential electrodes as well as by the location of the electrodes with reference to the local geologic structure.",10.1190/1.1441548
In‐Mine Seismic Delineation Of Mineralization And Rock Structure,"Significant progress has been made towards the goal of generating detailed seismic images as an aid to mine planning and exploration at the Kambalda nickel mines of Western Australia. Crosshole and vertical‐seismic‐profiling instrumentation, including a slimline multi‐element hydrophone array, three‐component geophone sensors, and a multishot detonator sound source, have been developed along with special seismic imaging software to map rock structure. Seismic trials at the Hunt underground mine established that high frequency ( 1 kHz) signals can be propagated over distances of tens of meters. Tomographic as well as novel 3-D multicomponent reflection imaging procedures have been applied to the data to produce useful pictures of the ore‐stope geometry and host rock. Tomogram interpretation remains problematic because velocity changes not only relate to differing rock types and/or the presence of mineralisation, but can also be caused by alteration/weathering and other rock condition variations. Ultrasonic measurements on rock core samples help in assigning velocity values to lithology, but geological assessment of tomograms remains ambiguous. Reflection imaging is complicated by the presence of strong tube‐wave to body‐wave mode conversion events present in the records, which obscure the weak reflection signatures. Three‐dimensional reflection data processing, especially three‐component analysis, is time consuming and difficult to perform. Notwithstanding the difficulties, the seismic migrations at the Hunt mine show a striking correlation with the known geology. Combined seismic and radar surveying from available underground boreholes and mine drivages is probably needed in the future to more confidently delineate mineralisation.",10.1190/1.1444875
Absorbing Boundary Conditions And Surface Waves,"One of the major problems in numerically simulating waves traveling in the Earth is that an artificial boundary must be introduced to produce unique solutions. To eliminate the spurious reflections introduced by this artificial boundary, we use a damping expression based on analogies to shock absorbers. This method can reduce the amplitude of the reflected wave to any pre‐specified value and is successful for waves at any angle of incidence. The method can eliminate unwanted reflections from the surface, reflections at the corners of the model, and waves reflected off an interface that strike the artificial boundary. Many of the boundary conditions currently used in the numerical solution of waves are approximations to perfectly absorbing boundary conditions and depend upon the angle of incidence of the incoming wave at the artificial boundary. Stability problems often occur with these boundary conditions. The method we use at the artificial boundary allows use of stable Dirichlet or von Neumann conditions. Since the surface motion is easily measured when the waves are induced by normal seismic techniques, approximations of surface waves are needed to obtain information on Rayleigh waves. An implicit finite‐difference scheme that is relatively easy to incorporate into existing numerical simulators is used to obtain the surface data for the forward finite‐difference approximations.",10.1190/1.1442241
Densities Determined From Surface And Subsurface Gravity Measurements,"A least‐squares method for the direct inversion of surface and subsurface gravity measurements to obtain in situ density estimates is presented. The method is applied to a set of measurements made in a tunnel through the flank of an andesitic volcano. Densities obtained are 2.14g/cm3 for material in the top 100 m increasing to 2.32g/cm3 at about 200 m depth. The average density for rocks penetrated by the tunnel is, from laboratory measurements, 2.42g/cm3 i.e., about 4 percent higher. The difference is ascribed to joints and voids present in situ and not sampled in the laboratory specimens.",10.1190/1.1441163
Focusing The Wavefield Inside An Unknown 1D Medium: Beyond Seismic Interferometry,"With seismic interferometry one can retrieve the response to a virtual source inside an unknown medium, if there is a receiver at the position of the virtual source. Using inverse scattering theory, we demonstrate that, for a 1D medium, the requirement of having an actual receiver inside the medium can be circumvented, going beyond seismic interferometry. In this case, the wavefield can be focused inside an unknown medium with independent variations in velocity and density using reflection data only.",10.1190/geo2012-0060.1
Interpretive Advantages Of 90°-Phase Wavelets: Part 2 — Seismic Applications,"We examine field seismic data to test the benefits of 90°-phase wavelets in thin-bed interpretation that are predicted by seismic modeling in part 1 of this paper. In an interbedded sandstone-shale Miocene succession in the Gulf of Mexico basin, a 90°-phase shift of nearly zero-phase seismic data significantly improves lithologic and stratigraphic interpretation. A match between seismic and acoustic impedance (AI) profiles results in a better tie between seismic amplitude traces and lithology-indicative logs. Better geometric imaging of AI units that does not use dual-polarity seismic events results in easier and more accurate reservoir delineation. Less amplitude distortion and the stratigraphy-independent nature of thin-bed interference significantly improves stratigraphic resolution and seismic stratigraphic profiling. For a Ricker-like wavelet having small side lobes, stratigraphic resolution of 90°-phase data is considerably higher than that of zero-phase data. In this specific case, stratigraphic resolution of 90°-phase data is λ/4 (λ = wavelength), compared with λ/2 for its zero-phase counterpart. Stratal slices made from 90°-phase data show geomorphologic patterns of depositional systems with less noise and fewer interference fingerprints. A Permian Basin field provides a real-world example of porous zones in thin, high-frequency carbonate sequences that are better visualized with 90°-phase seismic data than with zero-phase data.",10.1190/1.1925741
"A Seismic Analysis Of Black Creek And Wabumun Salt Collapse Features, Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin","Two Devonian salts of western Canada, those of the Black Creek member (Upper Elk Point subgroup) in northwest Alberta and those of the Wabamun group in southeastern Alberta, were widely distributed and uniformly deposited within their respective basins. Both of these salts are interbedded within predominantly carbonate sequences and both have been extensively leached. They are now preserved as discontinuous remnants of variable thickness and areal extent. These salt remnants and their associated collapse features are often associated with structural or stratigraphic traps. Structural traps typically form where reservoir facies are closed across remnant salts, stratigraphic traps often develop where reservoir facies were either preferentially deposited and/or preserved in salt collapse lows. As a result of these relationships between dissolution and hydrocarbon entrapment, the distribution (areal extent and thickness) of these salt remnants is of significant interest to the explorationist. Both the Black Creek and Wabamun salts have relatively abrupt contacts with the encasing higher velocity, higher density carbonates. Where these salts are sufficiently thick, their top and base typically generate high amplitude reflections, and lateral variations in the salt isopach can be directly determined from the seismic data. Relative salt thicknesses can also be indirectly estimated through analyses of lateral variations in the thicknesses of the encompassing carbonates, time structural drape and velocity pullup. Such seismic information about the thickness and the extent of these salts should be used together with well log control to generate subsurface distribution maps. These maps will facilitate both the delineation of prospective structural and stratigraphic play fairways and the determination of the timing of salt dissolution. In addition, an appreciation of regional salt distribution will decrease the likelihood that remnant salts will be misinterpreted as either reefs and/or faulted structures.",10.1190/1.1443078
Avo-Sensitive Semblance Analysis For Wide-Azimuth Data,"Conventional semblance-based moveout analysis models prestack reflection data with events that have hyperbolic move-out and no amplitude variation with offset (AVO). Substantial amplitude variation and even phase change with offset do not significantly compromise the semblance operator. However, polarity reversal associated with a change in the sign of the reflection coefficient may cause conventional semblance to fail. An existing modification of the semblance operator that takes amplitude variations into account (so-called AK semblance) is limited to narrow-azimuth data and cannot handle nonhyperbolic moveout at large offsets. We employ a 3D nonhyperbolic moveout inversion algorithm to extend the AK semblance method to wide-azimuth data recorded on long spreads. To preserve velocity resolu-tion, the ratio  K  of the AVO gradient and intercept is kept constant within each semblance window. In the presence of azimuthal anisotropy, however, the parameter  K  has to be azimuthally dependent. Synthetic tests confirm that distortions in moveout analysis caused by polarity reversals become more common for long-offset data. Conventional semblance produces substantial errors in the NMO ellipse and azimuthally varying anellipticity parameter  η  not just for class 2 AVO response but also for some models with class 1 AVO. In contrast, the AK semblance algorithm gives accurate estimates of the moveout parameters even when the position of the polarity reversal varies with azimuth. The AK method not only helps to flatten wide-azimuth reflection events prior to stacking and azimuthal AVO analysis but also provides input parameters for the anisotropic geometrical-spreading correction.",10.1190/1.2834115
An Analytical Solution To Separate P‐Waves And S‐Waves In Vsp Wavefields,"An analytical solution to separate P‐waves and S‐waves in vertical seismic profile (VSP) wavefields is derived using combinations of certain terms of the formal solution for forward VSP modeling. Some practical applications of this method to synthetic seismograms and field data are investigated and evaluated. Little wave distortion is recognized, and the weak wavefield masked by dominant wavetrains can be extracted with this method. The decomposed wavefield is expressed in the frequency‐depth (f-z) domain as a linear combination of up to the third‐order differential of traces, which is approximated by trace differences in the practical separation process. In general, five traces with single‐component data are required in this process, but the same process is implemented with only three traces in the acoustic case. Two‐trace extrapolation is applied to each edge of the data gather to enhance the accuracy of trace difference. Since the formulas are developed in the f-z domain, the influence of anelasticity can be taken into account, and the calculation is carried out fast enough with the benefit of the fast Fourier transform (FFT).",10.1190/1.1443861
Modeling And Velocity Analysis With A Wavefront-Construction Algorithm For Anisotropic Media,"Wavefront construction methods allow for efficient simulation of seismic wave propagation in anisotropic media using ray theory. This approach models an individual wavefront as a mesh that is adaptively refined as the wave travels through an earth model. The algorithm, implemented here for quasi-compressional waves, provides an effective tool for modeling and analyzing a large vertical seismic-profile data set from the Gulf of Mexico. Seismic velocities in this region generally increase linearly with depth, but simulations show that an isotropic vertical-gradient model cannot accurately reproduce traveltimes of first arrivals. However, a simple velocity-analysis inversion based on the wavefront-construction method allows a straightforward estimation of improved isotropic and transversely isotropic models that significantly reduce the misfit between computed traveltimes and the observations. The goal of this analysis is to produce a simple model suitable for use as a starting point for migrations and for assessing the importance of anisotropy in the field site. In fact, the final anisotropic model is much more consistent with background geologic information than the best isotropic model, which also has a larger rms traveltime error. The results strongly support the presence of measurable anisotropy.",10.1190/1.1988188
Application Of Time-Lapse Ert Imaging To Watershed Characterization,"Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has many practical applications to the study of subsurface properties and processes. When inverting time-lapse ERT data, it is useful to proceed beyond straightforward inversion of data differences and take advantage of the time-lapse nature of the data. We assess various approaches for inverting and interpreting time-lapse ERT data and determine that two approaches work well. The first approach is model subtraction after separate inversion of the data from two time periods, and the second approach is to use the inverted model from a base data set as the reference model or prior information for subsequent time periods. We prefer this second approach. Data inversion methodology should be consideredwhen designing data acquisition; i.e., to utilize the second approach, it is important to collect one or more data sets for which the bulk of the subsurface is in a background or relatively unperturbed state. A third and commonly used approach to time-lapse inversion, inverting the difference between two data sets, localizes the regions of the model in which change has occurred; however, varying noise levels between the two data sets can be problematic. To further assess the various time-lapse inversion approaches, we acquired field data from a catchment within the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho, U.S.A. We combined the complimentary information from individual static ERT inversions, time-lapse ERT images, and available hydrologic data in a robust interpretation scheme to aid in quantifying seasonal variations in subsurface moisture content.",10.1190/1.2907156
Relationship Of Magnetic Anomalies Due To Subsurface Features And The Interpretation Of Sloping Contacts,"A study of the magnetic anomalies produced by sloping geologic contacts, thin dikes, and horizontal cylinders has revealed that a single relationship exists among the magnetic anomalies created by them. The magnetic anomaly due to a horizontal cylinder, the first horizontal derivative of the magnetic anomaly due to a thin dike, and the second horizontal derivative of the magnetic anomaly due to a sloping contact are found to be identical in shape. Gay (1963, 1965) presented standard curves to interpret the magnetic anomalies over long tabular bodies (1963) and long horizontal cylinders (1965). It is shown here that the same curves can also be used to interpret the total, vertical and horizontal magnetic anomalies due to sloping geologic contacts.",10.1190/1.1441037
Applications Of Two‐Dimensional Linear Wavelength Filtering,"Wavelength filters permit the separation of anomalies of different horizontal extents on magnetic and gravity maps. They can be used equally well for structural and topographic maps or for any other type of data amenable to gridding. Practical filters were developed following two series of cutoff wavelengths. Of special interest is the small size of the filters as compared to the steepness and smoothness of their wavenumber characteristics. Filters for any desired wavelengths can easily be derived from the described coefficient sets. Examples are given for the application of filters which can be used as regional, residual, and band‐pass filters. The resultant maps are in the same units as the original maps. A given map can be divided into several wavelength components, and the sum of the components is equal to the original data. The method is shown to be versatile, and second‐derivative calculations can be approximated by a properly chosen residual filter.",10.1190/1.1439905
Remote Sensing Of Seismic Vibrations By Laser Doppler Interferometry,"The objective of this work is to sense seismic particle motion by recovering the Doppler shift of a laser beam that is directed to various ground spots from a remote location. This paper presents results from two field tests using experimental, laser‐based, data acquisition systems. In the first test, strong ground‐roll vibrations were detected at an 800-m range by reflecting the beam directly from various terrain targets. The weaker, seismic‐reflection events were inundated by a noise associated with propagation of the laser beam through the atmosphere. The second test used a novel optical interferometer that cancelled the turbulence noise. A reflector apparatus is needed at the ground target position to cancel the turbulence effects in this system.",10.1190/1.1443573
Distortion In Resistivity Logging At Shallow Depth,"Owing to the proximity of an insulating ground surface, normal resistivity logging at shallow depths (less than 30 m) can yield an apparent resistivity that exceeds 200% of the formation resistivity for a homogeneous medium. The distortion is more acute for long‐normal than for short‐normal logging. Three examples from a landfill site in southern California are presented to show such distortion. The patterns of distortion are similar for logging devices consisting of either two point‐source electrodes or one point‐source and one finite length, line‐source electrode. The former electrode array is a generally accepted approximation of the latter. However, the simulated apparent resistivity for the line‐source array is greater than that for the point‐source array at any given depth. A resistivity contrast between the formation and the borehole fluid can shift the magnitude of the background apparent resistivity but does not significantly alter the pattern of distortion. The magnitude of the distortion can be reduced by placing the reference‐ground potential electrode at a radial distance that is about equal to the spacing between the downhole upper potential electrode and the upper current electrode. It can also be removed by including the radial distance in an array‐dependent geometric factor that accounts for the resistivity of the borehole fluid and the proximity of the logging device to the ground surface.",10.1190/1.1443834
Reflector Imaging Using Trial Reflector And Crosscorrelation: Application To Fracture Imaging For Sonic Data,"I have developed two high-resolution imaging methods that do not require a priori information on the structural dip. The dip information is often necessary to image complex structures using Kirchhoff migration by selecting only the constructively interfering parts of waveforms, especially for data with limited acquisition geometry. However, such dip information is not generally available. The methods that I evaluated use a trial reflector, which is defined for each image point and source-receiver pair, to search for the true geologic reflector. The coincidence of these reflectors is judged by a coherency analysis of event signals for the trial reflector using the crosscorrelations, and the coherency is converted to a weight. The weight is combined with the stacking methods of waveform samples in migration. In the first method, a waveform sample summed at an image point for a source-receiver pair is obtained by the common-depth-point stack of array data for the trial reflector. In the second method, a waveform sample of a source-receiver pair at the traveltime of the reflected ray for the trial reflector is smeared in the Fresnel zone computed for the trial reflector. My methods were applied to image fractures for sonic data, whose frequency range is centered approximately 8 kHz, and they provide higher resolution images than those given by conventional Kirchhoff migration.",10.1190/geo2016-0046.1
Adaptive Decomposition Of Multicomponent Ocean‐Bottom Seismic Data Into Downgoing And Upgoing P‐ And S‐Waves,"In this study, the adaptive decomposition scheme is tested on a data example with a relatively shallow water depth (∼120 m), consisting recordings from of a full line of ocean‐bottom receivers. Although some of the individual stages in the decomposition scheme are more difficult to apply because of stronger interference between events compared to data acquired over deeper water, the end result is satisfying. Also, a good decomposition result is obtained for the S‐waves. The extension of the decomposition scheme to a complete line of ocean‐bottom cable data consists of a repeated application of the procedure for each receiver. The resulting decomposed upgoing P‐ and S‐wavefields are processed, yielding poststack time migrated images of the subsurface. Comparison with the images obtained from the original (i.e., not decomposed) measurements shows that wavefield decomposition just below the ocean bottom leads to a strong attenuation of multiply reflected events at the sea surface and better event definition in both P‐ and S‐wave sections. Other decomposition effects like improved angle‐dependent amplitudes cannot be evaluated in this way.",10.1190/1.1581081
Breakthrough Acquisition And Technologies For Subsalt Imaging,"The recently introduced method of wide-azimuth data acquisition offers better illumination, noise attenuation, and lower frequencies to more accurately determine a velocity field for imaging. For the field data experiment to demonstrate the technologies, we used a Gulf of Mexico (GOM) wide-azimuth data set that allows us to take advantage of possible low frequencies, relatively large crossline offsets, and increased illumination. The input data was processed through true 3D azimuthal surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) with zero-phasing and debubble. Eliminating the surface-related multiples aids the velocity determination and helps uncover the subsalt sediments at the final imaging stage. After the initial velocity derivation, which was constrained to wells and geology, full-waveform inversion (FWI) was used to further update the velocity field to achieve an enhanced image. The methodology used follows the top-down approach where suprasalt sediment model is developed followed by the top of salt, salt flanks, base of salt, and finished with a limited subsalt update. To approximate the observed data by using an acoustic inversion procedure, the propagator includes effects of attenuation, anisotropy, acquisition source, and receiver depth. The geological environment is salt related, which implies that the observed data is highly elastic, even though it is input to an acoustic full waveform inversion. To use the proper constraints for the inversion, layer-stripping method is used to develop the high-resolution velocity field. The inversion stages were carefully quality controlled through gather displays to ensure the kinematics were honored. We then demonstrated the benefit of the FWI velocity field by comparing the images derived with the traditional ray-based tomographic velocity field versus the velocity field derived by FWI performing reverse time migration to produce these images. Finally, the images were compared at key well locations to evaluate the robustness of the workflow.",10.1190/geo2010-0399.1
A Geophysical History Of The Lacq Field,"Whereas the first success of petroleum exploration in France (the gas deposit in the Saint‐Marcet anticline in the Saint‐Gaudens region) was essentially based on geological surveys, the second (the gas and oil deposits in the Lacq anticline, near Pau) was the result of geophysical techniques. In fact, the Lacq anticline cannot be detected by surface geological survey, because of Tertiary and Quaternary covering.",10.1190/1.1439870
Some Effects Of Velocity Variation On Avo And Its Interpretation,"In recent years interest has increased in the interpretation of the amplitude variation of reflected signals as a function of offset (AVO). A more meaningful relationship for interpreting reflection coefficients at the target horizon is amplitude variation with incident angle (AVA). The challenge is to convert from AVO to AVA. The effects of velocity variation in the overburden on amplitude variation with offset (AVO) and on the final inversion of AVO data into velocity, density, and Poisson's ratio can be significant. Examples are given here for subsurface medium with a vertical velocity gradient range of -0.2s-1 to 0.8s-1. When the medium is treated as homogeneous in the conversion from AVO to AVA, this velocity variation causes significant errors (about 10 percent) in both the gradient of AVA and in the normal incident reflection coefficient. Such errors produce errors of similar magnitude in the inversion of AVA data into the elastic parameters of velocity, Poisson's ratio, and density. The errors depend on the velocity gradient, the offset range, the elastic parameter contrast across the interface, and the interface depth.",10.1190/1.1443512
Fourier Forward Modeling Of Vector And Tensor Gravity Fields Due To Prismatic Bodies With Variable Density Contrast,"Prismatic bodies with variable density contrasts are very useful in modeling and inversion of gravity anomalies for sedimentary basins, in which some simple mathematical functions offer better approximations for the density-depth relationship of the basin fill than a constant density model. We have explored Fourier-domain modeling of vector and tensor gravity anomalies due to 2D and 3D prismatic bodies following a wide class of variable density functions. We placed the emphasis on general polynomial models because they provided a flexible way to approximate arbitrary density functions. The recently proposed Gauss-fast Fourier transform method was applied to improve the accuracy of inverse Fourier transform. The numerical performance of the presented method was examined by comparing with space-domain analytical, seminumerical, or completely numerical solutions. Singularity and numerical stability of the algorithm were also analyzed with ranges of numerical stability for polynomial density models of different orders specified. Truncation errors of Fourier forward methods were estimated quantitatively using relevant model parameters, and the behavior was observed through theoretical analysis and model tests. Synthetic models, of 2D and 3D prisms with variable density contrasts, found the accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility of the method. We also interpreted a real data example of the gravity profile across the San Jacinto graben.",10.1190/geo2014-0559.1
Leveling Total‐Field Aeromagnetic Data With Measured Horizontal Gradients,"Temporal changes in the earth's magnetic field occur in the frequency band of millihertz to a few Hertz. Amplitudes of variations above 0.1 Hz are usually much smaller than 1 nT, changes of 50–100 nT over periods of a few hours are not uncommon.",10.1190/1.1443673
Some Considerations Of The Mechanism Of The Generation Of Seismic Waves By Explosives,"The mechanism whereby an elastic pulse is generated in the ground due to the detonation of an explosive charge is discussed. Initially the pressure in the borehole is very high, of the order of several hundred tons per square inch. The sudden impact of this on the walls of the borehole causes a shock wave in the ground, the intensity of which is very much greater than the ground can bear, so that the wave rapidly loses energy in fracturing the ground, and degenerates into an elastic pulse at a distance defined as the critical radius. This elastic pulse is transmitted sensibly unchanged through the ground. The ground vibration detected by a geophone is the synthesis of this pulse modified by reflections and refractions at the interfaces of the geological formation of the site, spread out in time according to the paths along which the components have travelled. Although adequate quantitative information is lacking, an attempt is made to evaluate such a pulse at various stages of its career in order that the physical magnitudes involved may be appreciated.",10.1190/1.1437579
Reservoir Characterization Based On Seismic Spectral Variations,"The seismic frequency spectrum provides a useful source of information for reservoir characterization. For a seismic profile presented in the time-space domain, a vector of the frequency spectrum can be generated at every sampling point. Because the spectrum vectors at different time-space locations have different variation features, I attempt for the first time to exploit the variation pattern of the frequency spectrum for reservoir characterization, and test this innovative technology in prediction of coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs. The prediction process implicitly takes account of the CBM reservoir factors (such as viscosity, elasticity, cleat system, wave interference within a coal seam, etc.) that affect the frequency spectrum, but strong amplitudes in seismic reflections do not necessarily show any influence in clustering analysis of spectral variation patterns. By calibrating these variation patterns quantitatively with CBM productions in well locations, we are able to characterize the spatial distribution of potential reservoirs.",10.1190/geo2011-0323.1
Optimum Weighted Stack For Multiple Suppression,"In water deeper than about 300 m, common midpoint stack is moderately effective at suppressing multiple reflections. The stacking process acts as a low‐pass multiple filter, rejecting, to some extent, frequencies greater than the reciprocal of the multiple's residual moveout on the farthest offset trace. A weighted stack can often be even more effective at attenuating multiples, if the weights are chosen such that the multiple filter response has low amplitudes at those frequencies where the multiple is strong. A least‐squares technique is developed to determine optimum weights, based on the multiple's frequency content, the water depth, the primary velocity, and on a stabilization factor equivalent to white noise in deconvolution filter design. To be truly optimum, the weights must vary both spatially, to account for water‐depth changes, and temporally, to account for sediment velocity changes and mute patterns; but the filter responses are not very sensitive to the input parameters and need to be redesigned only infrequently. The superiority of weighted stacks to uniform stacks is demonstrated by application to three deep‐water examples. In all cases, weighted stacks attenuate multiples more effectively than do conventional uniform stacks.",10.1190/1.1444014
Numerical Integration Of Related Hankel Transforms Of Orders 0 And 1 By Adaptive Digital Filtering,"A linear digital filtering algorithm is presented for rapid and accurate numerical evaluation of Hankel transform integrals of orders 0 and 1 containing related complex kernel functions. The kernel for Hankel transforms is defined as the non‐Bessel function factor of the integrand. Related transforms are defined as transforms, of either order 0 or 1, whose kernel functions are related to one another by simple algebraic relationships. Previously saved kernel evaluations are used in the algorithm to obtain rapidly either order transform following an initial convolution operation. Each order filter is designed with identical abscissas over a large range so that an adaptive convolution procedure can be applied to a large class of kernels. Different order Hankel transforms with related kernels are often found in electromagnetic (EM) applications. Because of the general nature of this algorithm, the need to design new filters should not be necessary for most applications. Accuracy of the filters is comparable to that of single‐precision numerical quadrature methods, provided well‐behaved kernels and moderate values of the transform argument are used. Filtering errors of less than 0.005 percent are demonstrated numerically using known analytical Hankel transform pairs. The digital filter accuracy is also illustrated by comparison with other published filters for computing the apparent resistivity for a Schlumberger array over a horizontally layered earth model. The algorithm is written in Fortran IV and is listed in the Appendix along with a test driver program. Detailed comments are included to define sufficiently all calling parameter requirements.",10.1190/1.1441007
Maximum‐Entropy Spatial Processing Of Array Data,"The procedure of maximum‐entropy spectral analysis (MESA), used in the processing of time series data, also applies to wavenumber (bearing) analysis of signals received from a spatially distributed linear array of sensors. The method is precisely the use of autoregressive spectral analysis in the space dimension rather than in time. There are also close links to the predictive deconvolution method used in geophysical work, and to the process of constructing noise‐whitening filters in communication theory, as well as to least‐squares model building. In this note, we review the maximum‐entropy procedure pointing out all these links. The specific algorithm appropriate to a uniformly spaced line array of sensors is given, as well as one possible algorithm for use in the case of nonuniform sensor spacing.",10.1190/1.1440471
Optimum Second‐Derivative And Downward‐Continuation Filters,"Second‐derivative and downward‐continuation filtering are often employed to enhance gravity and magnetic maps. Noise due to aliasing, measurement errors, and near‐surface sources can be greatly amplified and lead to erratic filter outputs which produce spurious anomalies. To prevent this undesirable occurrence, it is often necessary to smooth the data, or equivalently, to modify the response of the applied filter. By means of the Wiener filter theory it is possible to derive optimum second‐derivative and downward‐continuation filters in either the wavenumber or space domain. Application of the theory involves separating the power spectrum into signal and noise components. A white noise assumption is realistic if the noise is due to small random near‐surface sources, random measurement errors, and random errors in corrections for terrain and elevation. As a striking demonstration of the superiority of optimum filters, the effects of optimum and ""ideal"" filters on a synthetic gravity map are compared.",10.1190/1.1440020
Reservoir Characterization Using Surface Microseismic Monitoring,"Microseismic monitoring of reservoir processes can be performed using surface or near-surface arrays. We review the published technical basis for the use of the arrays and the historical development of the method, beginning with locating earthquakes through geothermal exploration to the growing field of hydraulic-fracture monitoring. Practical considerations for the array deployment and data processing are presented. The road ahead for the technology includes a move toward life-of-field buried arrays as well as opportunities for extended interpretation of the data, particularly inversion for source-mechanism estimation and measurement of anisotropy in the monitored subsurface.",10.1190/1.3467760
Paraxial Ray Kirchhoff Migration,"A rapid nonrecursive prestack Kirchhoff migration is implemented (for 2-D or 2.5-D media) by computing the Green's functions (both traveltimes and amplitudes) in variable velocity media with the paraxial ray method. Since the paraxial ray method allows the Green's functions to be determined at points which do not lie on the ray, two‐point ray tracing is not required. The Green's functions between a source or receiver location and a dense grid of thousands of image points can be estimated to a desired accuracy by shooting a sufficiently dense fan of rays. For a given grid of image points, the paraxial ray method reduces computation time by one order of magnitude compared with interpolation schemes. The method is illustrated using synthetic data generated by acoustic ray tracing. Application to VSP data collected in a borehole adjacent to a reef in Michigan produces an image that clearly shows the location of the reef.",10.1190/1.1442435
Born Theory Of Wave‐Equation Dip Moveout,"Wave‐equation dip moveout (DMO) addresses the DMO amplitude problem of finding an algorithm which faithfully preserves angular reflectivity while processing data to zero offset. Only three fundamentally different theoretical approaches to the DMO amplitude problem have been proposed: (1) mathematical decomposition of a prestack migration operator; (2) intuitively accounting for specific amplitude factors; and (3) cascading operators for prestack migration (or inversion) and zero‐offset forward modeling. Pursuing the cascaded operator method, wave‐equation DMO for shot profiles has been developed. In this approach, a prestack common‐shot inversion operator is combined with a zero‐offset modeling operator. Both integral operators are theoretically based on the Born asymptotic solution to the point‐source, scalar wave equation. This total process, termed Born DMO, simultaneously accomplishes geometric spreading corrections, NMO, and DMO in an amplitude‐preserving manner. The theory is for constant velocity and density, but variable velocity can be approximately incorporated. Common‐shot Born DMO can be analytically verified by using Kirchhoff scattering data for a horizontal plane. In this analytic test, Born DMO yields the correct zero‐offset reflector with amplitude proportional to the angular reflection coefficient. Numerical tests of common‐shot Born DMO on synthetic data suggest that angular reflectivity is successfully preserved. In those situations where amplitude preservation is important, Born DMO is an alternative to conventional NMO + DMO processing.",10.1190/1.1443030
Experimental Studies Of Source‐Generated Seismic Noise,"Source‐generated seismic noise has been studied in several areas of Oklahoma and Texas having distinctly different near‐surface layering and velocities. Surface‐wave velocities, particularly those of the propagating modes, are closely related to near‐surface layer thickness and velocity. Modal structure is strongly influenced by the shooting parameters, of which charge depth is the most important. The Rayleigh or first propagating mode and the third propagating mode are readily identifiable on the noise records and agree satisfactorily with theory, if frequency‐dependent attenuation and modal overlapping are taken into account. Leaky modes are identifiable on the basis of their high phase and group velocities but to date have defied quantitative comparison with theory.",10.1190/1.1440235
On The Effect Of Random Timing Errors On Velocity Estimates Derived From Normal Moveout Estimates,"A number of authors (e.g., Brown, 1969; Hubral and Krey, 1980) have discussed systematic velocity estimation errors caused by nonhyperbolic normal moveout. The primary concern of these authors is often the departure of (presumably perfectly accurate measurements of) normal moveout from that predicted by Dix's (1955) equation. In this note the effect of measurement errors on velocity estimates is examined with the aid of standard statistical techniques. The concern is not deterministic errors, but those caused by random errors.",10.1190/1.1441762
Reflectivity Inversion For Attenuated Seismic Data: Physical Modeling And Field Data Experiments,"We have developed a method of nonstationary sparse reflectivity inversion (NSRI) that directly retrieves the reflectivity series from nonstationary seismic data without the intrinsic instability associated with inverse Q filtering methods. We have investigated the NSRI performance in the presence of input error (e.g., the phase shift and the peak frequency of the wavelet), which determined that NSRI results are reasonable in the case of moderate error. NSRI was then applied to data collected from a laboratory physical model made of highly attenuating media, for which true reflectivities were known, but the wave propagation and the Q filtering mechanism were not. Analysis of data from the physical model, therefore, represented a blind test for evaluating the effectiveness and accuracy of NSRI. The physical model had a specified spatial scale of 1:5000 (relative to the field scale) and an approximate 1:1 velocity scale. Because the Q input is required by NSRI, attenuation of the P-wave was measured in the laboratory at ultrasonic frequencies with a pulse transmission technique and the spectral ratio method. Although multiples, side reflections from the model boundaries, diffractions, and other event types were clearly observed from the raw data, no preprocessing was done to avoid affecting the Q filtering effects. Results from the physical modeling data demonstrated that the derived formula for an attenuated seismogram was correct and estimated Q values were reliable. The functions and advantages of NSRI were confirmed. The Q compensated seismogram generated by NSRI was superior to that generated using gain-limited inverse Q filtering. We have also investigated NSRI's capabilities in analyzing a marine data set from the Gulf of Suez. These examples provided a basis for discussing assumptions and limitations of NSRI.",10.1190/geo2015-0250.1
Directional Spectral Analysis And Filtering Of Geophysical Maps,"The detection of linear anomalies in map data is facilitated by studying the two‐dimensional power spectrum, because the directivity of the energy in the map is preserved in the Fourier transform. The lineaments associated with individual peaks in the spectrum are then separated from the map data by directional filtering and studied independently of other map features. Gravity and magnetic maps from an active rift area in southwestern Iceland are analyzed in this manner. The agreement between the filtered maps is good and they fit the observed tectonic features quite well.",10.1190/1.1442440
Relative Precision Of Vertical And Horizontal Gravity Gradients Measured By Gravimeter,"Several recent publications advocate the use of the vertical gradient of gravity from gravimeter measurements at two elevations in a portable tower (Thyssen‐Bornemisza, 1976; Fajklewicz, 1976; Mortimer, 1977). Contrary opinions have also been expressed (Hammer and Anzoleaga, 1975; Stanley and Green, 1976; Thysen‐Bornemisza, 1977; Arzi, 1977). The disagreement revolves around the question of practically attainable precision of the vertical gradient tower method.   Although it is possible to calculate both horizontal and vertical gradients from conventional gravity survey data by use of the Hilbert transform (Stanley and Green, 1976), it should be noted that highly precise gravity data are required. Also the need for connected elevation and location surveys, the major cost in gravity surveying, is not avoided. This is a significant advantage of the gradient methods. The purpose here is to present a brief consideration of the relative precision of the horizontal and vertical gradients, as measured in the field by special gravimeter observations.",10.1190/1.1440926
Phase Measurements Of Electromagnetic Field Components,A method of phase measurement of electromagnetic field components produced by dipoles on a stratified conducting half‐space is described. A symmetric process with a high frequency transmitter and two high frequency receivers is used in order to get a phase reference. This method has been applied to the measurement of the phase of the component Eθ radiated by a horizontal electrical dipole on a stratified conducting half‐space. The expression for the phase of Eθ for a N‐layered medium is calculated numerically. Computations for a three‐layered model show good agreement with the measured results.,10.1190/1.1440135
Iterative Asymptotic Inversion In The Acoustic Approximation,"We propose an iterative method for the linearized prestack inversion of seismic profiles based on the asymptotic theory of wave propagation. For this purpose, we designed a very efficient technique for the downward continuation of an acoustic wavefield by ray methods. The different ray quantities required for the computation of the asymptotic inverse operator are estimated at each diffracting point where we want to recover the earth image. In the linearized inversion, we use the background velocity model obtained by velocity analysis. We determine the short wavelength components of the impedance distribution by linearized inversion of the seismograms observed at the surface of the model. Because the inverse operator is not exact, and because the source and station distribution is limited, the first iteration of our asymptotic inversion technique is not exact. We improve the images by an iterative procedure. Since the background velocity does not change between iterations. There is no need to retrace rays, and the same ray quantities are used in the iterations. For this reason our method is very fast and efficient. The results of the inversion demonstrate that iterations improve the spatial resolution of the model images since they mainly contribute to the increase in the short wavelength contents of the final image. A synthetic example with one‐dimensional (1-D) velocity background illustrates the main features of the inversion method. An example with two‐dimensional (2-D) heterogeneous background demonstrates our ability to handle multiple arrivals and a nearly perfect reconstruction of a flat horizon once the perturbations above it are known. Finally, we consider a seismic section taken from the Oseberg oil field in the North Sea off Norway. We show that the iterative asymptotic inversion is a reasonable and accurate alternative to methods based on finite differences. We also demonstrate that we are able to handle an important amount of data with presently available computers.",10.1190/1.1443328
Investigation Of A Vlf Airborne Resistivity Survey Conducted In Northern Maine,"Airborne wavetilt resistivity surveys and profiles at VLF have been analyzed for the effects of topography, altitude, and wavetilt phase and amplitude. Topographic relief is known to affect at least one electric field component, flight altitude often varies over relief, and phase, upon which the airborne measurement depends and which cannot be separated from amplitude by an airborne antenna system, depends on the earth's resistivity stratification and the relative strength of displacement to conduction current. A mountainous area in northern Maine of predominantly slate, but containing an igneous stock, was surveyed at 150 m mean flight altitude. The 150-m survey was repeated at 300 m, and two of the 150-m flight lines were repeated at a total of three other altitudes. A comparison of the 150-m survey with the topography and with the 300-m survey revealed that although most of the resistivity information of the 150-m survey was retained at 300 m, serious differences arose due to topographic influences. Profiles of the individual electric field components at the various altitudes then revealed that topography was distorting resistivity values through its effect upon only the vertical component of the electric field. The separate influences of phase and amplitude were analyzed using the results of a ground survey of the total, complex surface impedance. The phase of the tilt proved to be important in the airborne differentiation of the rock types. The entire 150-m survey was reevaluated with topographic effects removed from the vertical electric field. The resolution of the igneous geology improved and several of these improvements were verified by the ground measurements. In addition, it is concluded from a comparison of the 300-m survey with both the topographically corrected and uncorrected 150-m surveys that wavetilt is not preserved with altitude over ground resistivity anomalies.",10.1190/1.1440904
The Use Of Vertical Seismic Profiles In Seismic Investigations Of The Earth,"During the past 8 years, the U.S. Geological Survey has conducted an extensive investigation on the use of vertical seismic profiles (VSP) in a variety of seismic exploration applications. Seismic sources used were surface air guns, vibrators, explosives, marine air guns, and downhole air guns. Source offsets have ranged from 100 to 7800 ft. Well depths have been from 1200 to over 10,000 ft. We have found three specific ways in which VSPs can be applied to seismic exploration. First, seismic events observed at the surface of the ground can be traced, level by level, to their point of origin within the earth. Thus, one can tie a surface profile to a well log with an extraordinarily high degree of confidence. Second, one can establish the detectability of a target horizon, such as a porous zone. One can determine (either before or after surface profiling) whether or not a given horizon or layered sequence returns a detectable reflection to the surface. The amplitude and character of the reflection can also be observed. Third, acoustic properties of a stratigraphic sequence can be measured and sometimes correlated to important exploration parameters. For example, sometimes a relationship between apparent attenuation and sand percentage can be established. The technique shows additional promise of aiding surface exploration indirectly through studies of the evolution of the seismic pulse, studies of ghosts and multiples, and studies of seismic trace inversion techniques. Nearly all current seismic data‐processing techniques are adaptable to the processing of VSP data, such as normal  moveout (NMO) corrections, stacking, single‐and multiple‐channel filtering, deconvolution, and wavelet shaping.",10.1190/1.1441357
Model For Estimating Electric Macroanisotropy Coefficient Of Aquifers With Horizontal And Vertical Fractures,Electrically resistant beds often contain water‐bearing fractures having a much lower resistivity than the beds themselves. This paper presents a model for estimating the macroanisotropy coefficient of such fractured beds.,10.1190/1.1440705
Digital Soil Mapping Of Compositional Particle-Size Fractions Using Proximal And Remotely Sensed Ancillary Data,"The soil particle-size fractions (PSFs) are one of the most important attributes to influence soil physical (e.g., soil hydraulic properties) and chemical (e.g., cation exchange) processes. There is an increasing need, therefore, for high-resolution digital prediction of PSFs to improve our ability to manage agricultural land. Consequently, use of ancillary data to make cheaper high-resolution predictions of soil properties is becoming popular. This approach is known as ""digital soil mapping."" However, most commonly employed techniques (e.g., multiple linear regression or MLR) do not consider the special requirements of a regionalized composition, namely PSF; (1) should be nonnegative (2) should sum to a constant at each location, and (3) estimation should be constrained to produce an unbiased estimation, to avoid false interpretation. Previous studies have shown that the use of the additive log-ratio transformation (ALR) is an appropriate technique to meet the requirements of a composition. In this study, we investigated the use of ancillary data (i.e., electromagnetic (EM), gamma-ray spectrometry, Landsat TM, and a digital elevation model to predict soil PSF using MLR and generalized additive models (GAM) in a standard form and with an ALR transformation applied to the optimal method (GAM-ALR). The results show that the use of ancillary data improved prediction precision by around 30% for clay, 30% for sand, and 7% for silt for all techniques (MLR, GAM, and GAM-ALR) when compared to ordinary kriging. However, the ALR technique had the advantage of adhering to the special requirements of a composition, with all predicted values nonnegative and PSFs summing to unity at each prediction point and giving more accurate textural prediction.",10.1190/geo2012-0053.1
Empirical Mode Decomposition For Seismic Time-Frequency Analysis,"Time-frequency analysis plays a significant role in seismic data processing and interpretation. Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition decomposes a seismic signal into a sum of oscillatory components, with guaranteed positive and smoothly varying instantaneous frequencies. Analysis on synthetic and real data demonstrates that this method promises higher spectral-spatial resolution than the short-time Fourier transform or wavelet transform. Application on field data thus offers the potential of highlighting subtle geologic structures that might otherwise escape unnoticed.",10.1190/geo2012-0199.1
Effects Of Fluids And Dual-Pore Systems On Pressure-Dependent Velocities And Attenuations In Carbonates,"The effects of fluid substitution on P- and S-wave velocities in carbonates of complex texture are still not understood fully. The often-used Gassmann equation gives ambiguous results when compared with ultrasonic velocity data. We present theoretical modeling of velocity and attenuation measurements obtained at a frequency of   750 kHz   for six carbonate samples composed of calcite and saturated with air, brine, and kerosene. Although porosities (2%–14%) and permeabilities   (0–74 mD)   are relatively low, velocity variations are large. Differences between the highest and lowest P- and S-wave velocities are about 18% and 27% for brine-saturated samples at 60 and   10 MPa   effective pressure, respectively. S-wave velocities are measured for two orthogonal polarizations; for four of six samples, anisotropy is revealed. TheGassmann model underpredicts fluid-substitution effects by   2%   for three samples and by as much as 5% for the rest of the six samples. Moreover, when dried, they also show decreasing attenuation with increasing confining pressure. To model this behavior, we examine a pore model made of two pore systems: one constitutes the main and drainable porosity, and the other is made of undrained cracklike pores that can be associated with grain-to-grain contacts. In addition, these dried rock samples are modeled to contain a fluid-filled-pore system of grain-to-grain contacts, potentially causing local fluid flow and attenuation. For the theoretical model, we use an inclusion model based on the  T -matrix approach, which also considers effects of pore texture and geometry, and pore fluid, global- and local-fluid flow. By using a dual-pore system, we establish a realistic physical model consistently describing the measured data.",10.1190/1.2969774
Kirchhoff Imaging Beyond Aliasing,"Crucial image resolution may be lost when spatially aliased data are imaged with Kirchhoff algorithms that employ standard antialiasing methods. To maximize resolution, I introduce a method that enables the proper imaging of some aliased components in the data, while avoiding aliasing artifacts. The proposed method is based on a detailed analysis of the different types of aliasing that affect Kirchhoff imaging. In particular, it is based on the observation that operator aliasing depends on the dip spectrum of the data. A priori knowledge on the characteristics of the dip spectrum of the data, in particular on its asymmetry, can thus be exploited to enable ""imaging beyond aliasing."" The method is not of general applicability, but it successfully improves the image resolution when a priori assumptions on the data dips are realistic. The imaging of salt‐dome flanks in the Gulf of Mexico has been enhanced by the application of the proposed method.",10.1190/1.1444956
Exploring Trends In Microcrack Properties Of Sedimentary Rocks: An Audit Of Dry-Core Velocity-Stress Measurements,"Rock-physics models are used increasingly to link fluid and mechanical deformation parameters for dynamic elastic modeling. We explore the input parameters of an analytical stress-dependent rock-physics model. To do this, we invert for the stress-dependent microcrack parameters of more than 150 sedimentary rock velocity-stress core measurements taken from a literature survey. The inversion scheme is based on a microstructural effective-medium formulation defined by a second-rank crack-density tensor (scalar crack model) or by a second- and fourth-rank crack-density tensor (joint inversion model). Then the inversion results are used to explore and predict the stress-dependent elastic behavior of various sedimentary rock lithologies using an analytical microstructural rock-physics model via the initial modelinput parameters: initial crack aspect ratio and initial crack density. Estimates of initial crack aspect ratio are consistent among most lithologies with a mean of 0.0004, but for shales they differ up to several times in magnitude with a mean of 0.001. Estimates of initial aspect ratio are relatively insensitive to the inversion method, although the scalar crack inversion becomes less reliable at low values of normal-to-tangential crack compliance ratio   ( BN ∕ BT )  . Initial crack density is sensitive to the degree of damage as well as the inversion procedure. An important implication is that the fourth-rank crack-density term is not necessarily negligible for most sedimentary rocks and evaluation of this term or    BN ∕ BT    is necessary for accurate prediction of initial crack density. This is especially important because recent studies suggest that    BN ∕ BT    can indicate fluid content in cracks.",10.1190/1.3183940
Removal Of Overburden Transmission Effects By Deterministic Deconvolution,"Intrabed multiples, either caused by shallow reverberations or the presence of many thin layers, can have a detrimental effect on the signature of deeper reflections. We discuss a method for removing these types of multiples. It can be viewed as a deterministic counterpart of well‐known predictive deconvolution methods and is aimed at estimating the inverse transmission operator of a subsurface region, directly from its reflection response. The method is illustrated by applying it to both synthetic and real data and appears to be able to reduce the effect of transmission intrabed multiples.",10.1190/1.1444263
Premine Study Of Shallow Coal Seams Using High‐Resolution Seismic Reflection Methods,"Geological investigations in the Illinois Basin coalfields have shown that significant differences in safe and economical exploitation of coal depends directly on accurate mapping of the roof rock overlying the seam, as well as on geological structures in the coal measures. In roof rock transition zones above the Herrin (No. 6) coal where the nonmarine Energy shale changes to the Anna shale, a change often occurs from low to high sulfur coal and from low to high stability roof rocks. In many instances, use of borehole data alone is inadequate to locate these features in advance of mining. High‐resolution seismic reflection data collected near Harco, Illinois were used as part of premine planning to help predict roof instability, areas of low sulfur coal, and geologic disturbances. Several faults, channels, and facies changes affecting the Herrin (No. 6) and the Springfield (No. 5) coal seams at depths of 137 m and 167 m, respectively, were interpreted and modeled. One‐ and two‐dimensional synthetic seismograms calculated from geological data from drill holes along the seismic line were used to aid in the interpretion of the seismic reflection data. Results obtained from the high‐resolution reflection survey combined with drill hole information clearly show that use of borehole data alone is inadequate to locate geological features that might affect coal mine operations, even if the boreholes were spaced 25 m apart. Thus, high‐resolution reflection surveying should be employed whenever feasible for the safe and economical exploitation of coal deposits.",10.1190/1.1443171
Coupled Geomechanics And Flow Simulation For Time‐Lapse Seismic Modeling,"To accurately predict production in compactible reservoirs, we must use coupled models of fluid flow and mechanical deformation. Staggered‐in‐time loose coupling of flow and deformation via a high‐level numerical interface that repeatedly calls first flow and then mechanics allows us to leverage the decades of work put into individual flow and mechanics simulators while still capturing realistic coupled physics. These two processes are often naturally modeled using different time stepping schemes and different spatial grids—flow should only model the reservoir, whereas mechanics requires a grid that extends to the earth's surface for overburden loading and may extend further than the reservoir in the lateral directions. Although spatial and temporal variability between flow and mechanics can be difficult to accommodate with full coupling, it is easily handled via loose coupling. We calculate the total stress by adding pore pressures to the effective rock stress. In turn, changes in volume strain induce updates to porosity and permeability and, hence, dynamically alter the flow solution during simulation. Incorporating the resulting time‐dependent pressures, saturations, and porosities (from coupled flow and mechanics) into Gassmann's equations results in seismic wave velocities and densities that can differ markedly from those calculated from flow alone. In a synthetic numerical experiment based on Belridge field, California, incorporation of coupled flow and mechanical deformation into time‐lapse calculations produces compressional wave velocities that differ markedly from those produced by flow alone. In fact, it is the closing of the pores themselves (reduction in permeability) in this example which has the greatest impact on fluid pressures and saturations and, hence, elastic wave parameters such as velocity.",10.1190/1.1649388
Wave Tracing: Ray Tracing For The Propagation Of Band-Limited Signals: Part 2 — Applications,"Modeling seismic propagation is critically important to our work; unfortunately, we often must trade simulation accuracy for reduced computational expense. We present a new seismic-modeling method that is as simple and computationally efficient as Snell's law ray tracing but provides propagation paths and arrival times more consistent with finite-bandwidth data. We refer to this modeling method as wave tracing and apply it to nonlinear traveltime tomography and depth imaging. By replacing Snell's law ray tracing with wave tracing, we get better ray coverage, more robust and faster ray bending (fewer iterations), and a much more robust and faster algorithm for nonlinear tomography (fewer iterations, too). A very significant benefit is increased stability and robustness of tomographic inversion with respect to small changes in model parameterization and regularization. A related benefit is the increased stability of depth images with respect to small changes in velocity, which can increase confidence in interpretation. The velocity models that result from wave tracing match picked arrival times in band-limited data better and generate improved depth images. These advantages of wave tracing relative to conventional Snell's law ray tracing have been tested on both synthetic and real data examples for crosswell seismic geometry.",10.1190/1.2963515
Localized S‐Inversion Of Time‐Domain Electromagnetic Data,"Interpretation of time‐domain electromagnetic (TDEM) data over inhomogeneous geological structures is a challenging problem of geophysical exploration. The most widely used approach of interpreting TDEM data is based on the smooth 1‐D layered resistivity inversion. We have developed an effective technique of fast TDEM inversion based on thin‐sheet conductance approximation that we call S‐inversion. In this paper we extend the S‐inversion technique, approximating the conductivity cross‐section by adding a local inhomogeneous disk with an excess conductance ΔS to the horizontal conductive thin sheet used in S‐inversion. Localized S‐inversion determines the distribution of this excess conductance as a function of a depth and a horizontal coordinate. This new method takes into account the limited horizontal extent of the inhomogeneities, localizing inversion. The numerical modeling results and inversion of practical TDEM data demonstrate that the method resolves local geological targets better than traditional 1‐D inversion and original S‐inversion. The method can be applied to interpret both ground and airborne TDEM data sets.",10.1190/1.1500372
Multiple-Input Adaptive Seismic Noise Canceller For The Attenuation Of Nonstationary Coherent Noise,"Attenuation of coherent noise, typically weather generated noise and more specifically swell noise, is a major concern in seismic. Such noise, usually characterized by its low-frequency content and high amplitudes, is a common problem in seismic acquisition and, in particular, for marine data. We propose a multiple-input adaptive noise canceller as a solution to attenuate nonstationary coherent noise. This filter uses multiple noise sequences to estimate the noise contained in each trace. This noise estimate is then subtracted to obtain an estimate of the trace whose coherent noise has been attenuated. For the implementation of the adaptive filter, we use a variable step-size normalized least mean squares algorithm, as it is known for its simplicity and robustness. In addition, we demonstrate that variable step-size is necessary for this filter to adapt to the changing statistics of the seismic data. This method is tested on real marine seismic data and compared to a time-frequency median filter and a second-order high-pass Butterworth filter. We demonstrate that the multiple-input adaptive noise canceller is a powerful and efficient filter to attenuate swell noise while preserving the seismic reflections. Depending on the noise configuration, it can be used either by itself or in combination with a time-frequency median filter to obtain the best results.",10.1190/geo2010-0367.1
Experimental Determination Of Effective Demagnetizing Factors For A Short Cylinder,"Comparison between measurements on spheres and cylinders shows that a short cylinder with axial ratio (length/diameter) ≃0.9 and susceptibility ≃0.8 (cgs) has an effective demagnetizing factor N ≃ 3.7 both in the axial and radial directions. Hence, for a short cylinder with high susceptibility, the sum of the effective demagnetizing factors in three mutually perpendicular directions is less than 4π. This is important to know e.g., when determining the magnetic properties of highly magnetic magnetite ore samples.",10.1190/1.1440544
Automated Identification Of Rock Boundaries: An Application Of The Walsh Transform To Geophysical Well‐Log Analysis,"A system of orthogonal functions, known as Walsh functions, which assume only the values +1 and −1, are presented as a tool appropriate for the analysis of well‐log data. Many of the characteristics of these rectangular waveforms, such as discrete transitions in signal level, make them ideal for processing borehole data. Using the generalized Fourier transform, the basic equations for the Walsh transform and Walsh power spectrum are developed showing how the energy in a given signal is distributed among these rectangular wave components. As a first application of the Walsh transform to logging data, a method of computeraided rock boundary identification is developed and demonstrated on a set of well logs from a continental basalt sequence. This technique provides a fast, simple yet accurate means of dividing well‐log data into groups of measurements corresponding to different rock units.",10.1190/1.1441458
Inversion Of Induced Polarization Data,"We develop three methods to invert induced polarization (IP) data. The foundation for our algorithms is an assumption that the ultimate effect of chargeability is to alter the effective conductivity when current is applied. This assumption, which was first put forth by Siegel and has been routinely adopted in the literature, permits the IP responses to be numerically modeled by carrying out two forward modelings using a DC resistivity algorithm. The intimate connection between DC and IP data means that inversion of IP data is a two‐step process. First, the DC potentials are inverted to recover a background conductivity. The distribution of chargeability can then be found by using any one of the three following techniques: (1) linearizing the IP data equation and solving a linear inverse problem, (2) manipulating the conductivities obtained after performing two DC resistivity inversions, and (3) solving a nonlinear inverse problem. Our procedure for performing the inversion is to divide the earth into rectangular prisms and to assume that the conductivity σ and chargeability η are constant in each cell. To emulate complicated earth structure we allow many cells, usually far more than there are data. The inverse problem, which has many solutions, is then solved as a problem in optimization theory. A model objective function is designed, and a ""model"" (either the distribution of σ or η)is sought that minimizes the objective function subject to adequately fitting the data. Generalized subspace methodologies are used to solve both inverse problems, and positivity constraints are included. The IP inversion procedures we design are generic and can be applied to 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D earth models and with any configuration of current and potential electrodes. We illustrate our methods by inverting synthetic DC/IP data taken over a 2-D earth structure and by inverting dipole‐dipole data taken in Quebec.",10.1190/1.1443692
The Potential Of Digital Seismic Recordings For Multichannel Processing,"The availability of seismic digital field recording equipment has made possible new processing techniques which achieve significant reflection data enhancement. Typical of the processes that are now used routinely are deconvolution, autocorrelation and crosscorrelation, Fourier transformation, and spectral alteration. A recording fidelity that reduces errors to 1 part in 10,000 has provided the motive for developing and using these techniques. An additional capability of digital field equipment is the recording of amplifier gain information to a precision of 0.1 percent. This appears to provide a motive for developing multichannel processes which expand further our processing capabilities beyond the essentially single channel ones now in use. The present study evaluates the multichannel processing potential afforded by present day seismic digital field recording systems. The evaluation is based on measurement and computation of the effects of channel performance deviations. Each component of the field recording system (geophone, cable, amplifier, filters, sampling skew) separately, and the system as a whole, are evaluated in this context. Results of the study indicate that whereas any given channel possesses a dynamic range of 80 db, channel‐to‐channel variations establish a dynamic range of only 15 db. The 15 db range sets a serious limit on the performance of multichannel processes and points up the need for additional improvements in field hardware capabilities.",10.1190/1.1440107
Cascaded F-K Migration: Removing The Restrictions On Depth‐Varying Velocity,"Stolt's frequency‐wavenumber (f-k) method is computationally efficient and has unlimited dip accuracy for constant‐velocity media. Although the f-k method can handle moderate vertical velocity variations, errors become unacceptable for steep dips when such variations are large. This paper describes an extension to the f-k method that removes its restrictions on vertical velocity variation, yielding accuracy comparable to phase‐shift migration at only a fraction of the computational time. This extension of the f-k method is based on partitioning the velocity field, just as in cascaded finite‐difference migration, and performing a number of stages of f-k migration. In each stage, the migration‐velocity field is closer to a constant—the ideal situation for the f-k migration method—than when the migration is done conventionally (i.e., in just one stage). Empirical results and error analyses show that, at most, four stages of the cascaded f-k algorithm are sufficient to migrate steep events as accurately as by the phase‐shift method for virtually any vertically inhomogeneous velocity field. Given its accuracy and efficiency, cascaded f-k migration can become the method of choice for 2-D, two‐pass 3-D, and single‐pass 3-D time migrations.",10.1190/1.1442525
Closed-Loop Surface-Related Multiple Elimination And Its Application To Simultaneous Data Reconstruction,"Surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) is one of the most commonly used methods for suppressing surface multiples. However, to obtain an accurate surface multiple estimation, dense source and receiver sampling is required. The traditional approach to this problem is performing data interpolation prior to multiple estimation. Although appropriate in many cases, this methodology fails when big data gaps are present or when relevant information is not recovered, e.g., near-offset data in shallow-water environments. We have developed a solution in which multiple estimation was performed simultaneously with data reconstruction, such that data reconstruction helped obtain better multiple estimates and in which the physical primary-multiple relationship helped constrain the data interpolation. To accomplish this, we proposed to extend the recently introduced closed-loop SRME (CL-SRME) algorithm to account for primary estimation in the case of coarsely sampled data. We achieved this by introducing a focal-domain parameterization of the primaries in a sparsity-promoting CL-SRME method. Results proved that the method was capable of reliably estimating primaries data in case of shallow water and with large undersampling factors.",10.1190/geo2015-0287.1
Migration Before Stack—Procedure And Significance,"Common‐depth‐point (CDP) stacking is based on the assumption that reflection points are coincident and situated midway between the respective source and receiver locations. If the reflector is structurally deformed, the reflection points move updip from the midpoint. As the structural dip increases, the reflection points for a CDP group of traces are farther removed from each other and normal stacking procedures [i.e., reflection apparent velocities for horizontal reflectors used for normal moveout (NMO) corrections] become increasingly inaccurate. Under such circumstances prestack migration is desirable, particularly when high frequencies are to be preserved. One published approach to prestack migration (Sattlegger and Stiller, 1973) involves the generation of substacks of adjacent traces followed by migration and summation of individual substacks. While adequate in many instances, cases exist where even substacks are degraded by the reflection time differential between component traces. This paper discusses an alternative technique to prestack migration without recourse to substacks. Common‐source traces, after gain recovery and static time corrections but before NMO corrections, are migrated using Kirchhoff summation. Aperture is computed for each sample according to specified maximum dips. Traces are simultaneously migrated and stacked, then output sequentially in sets of 12. The method is economical and provides enhanced reflection continuity and reliability in comparison to poststack migration. Moreover, the collapsing of diffractions is more effective.",10.1190/1.1441077
Internal Friction Of Fine‐Grained Limestones At Ultrasonic Frequencies,"Ultrasonic pulse measurements in the 3 to 10 mc/sec frequency range were made of shear and dilatational absorption and velocity for three samples of fine grained, homogeneous, and well compacted limestones at atmospheric conditions. The complex moduli of elasticity were calculated for two limestone specimens of different grain size and porosity. A ""hysteresis"" or ""solid‐friction"" type of loss for waves of dilatation was found in all three limestone specimens. Shear measurements made in one of the limestones also show a ""hysteresis"" type of loss. Comparison of the dilatational loss in a single crystal of calcite to the dilatational loss in the limestones indicates that the internal friction for the limestone specimens probably occurs at the grain boundaries.",10.1190/1.1438583
Finite‐Difference Modeling Of Elastic Wave Propagation: A Nonsplitting Perfectly Matched Layer Approach,"In this paper, we present a nonsplitting perfectly matched layer (NPML) method for the finite‐difference simulation of elastic wave propagation. Compared to the conventional split‐field approach, the new formulation solves the same set of equations for the boundary and interior regions. The nonsplitting formulation simplifies the perfectly matched layer (PML) algorithm without sacrificing the accuracy of the PML. In addition, the NPML requires nearly the same amount of computer storage as does the split‐field approach. Using the NPML, we calculate dipole and quadrupole waveforms in a logging‐while‐drilling environment. We show that a dipole source produces a strong pipe flexural wave that distorts the formation arrivals of interest. A quadrupole source, however, produces clean formation arrivals. This result indicates that a quadrupole source is more advantageous over a dipole source for shear velocity measurement while drilling.",10.1190/1.1620648
Efficient Laplace-Domain Modeling And Inversion Using An Axis Transformation Technique,"We tested an axis-transformation technique for modeling wave propagation in the Laplace domain using a finite-difference method. This technique enables us to use small grids near the surface and large grids at depth. Accordingly, we can reduce the number of grids and attain computational efficiency in modeling and inversion in the Laplace domain. We used a dispersion analysis and comparisons between modeled wavefields obtained on the regular and transformed axes. We demonstrated in a synthetic Laplace-domain inversion technique shows that this method is efficient and yields a result comparable to that of a Laplace-domain inversion using a regular grid. In a synthetic inversion example, the memory usage reduced to less than 33%, and the computation time reduced to 39% of those required for the regular grid case using a logarithmic transformation function.",10.1190/geo2011-0424.1
An Electronic Gravimeter To Measure G(R),"We point out that a battery may be designed so that in a gravitational field it will have a gravitationally induced emf in addition to an electrochemical one. The gravitationally induced emf of a battery with a small ""effective"" electrochemical potential and a long ""effective"" length can readily be measured to very high precision by means of any precise voltmeter, and in particular by a Josephson junction. Such a device may be employed to measure any component of the gravitational acceleration vector. It can be constructed compactly enough to be placed down a borehole. Thus, in principle it is an extremely precise and adaptable tool for geophysical exploration.",10.1190/1.1441405
Technique For Correcting For Overburden Effects In Ground Level Radiometric Surveys Of Uranium Ore Bodies,"An experimental study of the effect of barren overburden on the gamma‐ray spectrum of uranium ore has been made. This has shown that counts in either of the two energy windows 0.56 to 0.64 MeV or 0.66 to 1.01 MeV may be used to correct for the decrease in total count rate as a result of overburden. The correction is limited to an overburden thickness‐density product of approximately 60g/cm2, which is equivalent to a correction factor of 16. Theoretical spectra have been modeled for a geometry similar to that used in the experiment and agree in the changes in spectral shape with overburden thickness. The calculations have also been used to evaluate the effects of ore thickness and to determine the useful limits of the correction factors. The method is mainly applicable to a mining environment where sufficiently high count rates exist.",10.1190/1.1440925
Avo Inversion And Poroelasticity With P- And S-Wave Moduli,"The fluid term in the Biot-Gassmann equation plays an important role in reservoir fluid discrimination. The density term imbedded in the fluid term, however, is difficult to estimate because it is less sensitive to seismic amplitude variations. We combined poroelasticity theory, amplitude variation with offset (AVO) inversion, and identification of P- and S-wave moduli to present a stable and physically meaningful method to estimate the fluid term, with no need for density information from prestack seismic data. We used poroelasticity theory to express the fluid term as a function of P- and S-wave moduli. The use of P- and S-wave moduli made the derivation physically meaningful and natural. Then we derived an AVO approximation in terms of these moduli, which can then be directly inverted from seismic data. Furthermore, this practical and robust AVO-inversion technique was developed in a Bayesian framework. The objective was to obtain the maximum a posteriori solution for the P-wave modulus, S-wave modulus, and density. Gaussian and Cauchy distributions were used for the likelihood and a priori probability distributions, respectively. The introduction of a low-frequency constraint and statistical probability information to the objective function rendered the inversion more stable and less sensitive to the initial model. Tests on synthetic data showed that all the parameters can be estimated well when no noise is present and the estimated P- and S-wave moduli were still reasonable with moderate noise and rather smooth initial model parameters. A test on a real data set showed that the estimated fluid term was in good agreement with the results of drilling.",10.1190/geo2011-0214.1
Enhancing The Resolving Power Of Least‐Squares Inversion With Active Constraint Balancing,"We present a new regularization approach, in which the Lagrangian multiplier is set as a spatial variable at each parameterized block and automatically determined via the parameter resolution matrix and spread function analysis. For highly resolvable parameters, a small value of the Lagrangian multiplier is assigned, and vice versa. This approach, named ""active constraint balancing"" (ACB), tries to balance the constraints of the least‐squares inversion according to sensitivity for a given problem so that it enhances the resolution as well as the stability of the inversion process. We demonstrate the performance of the ACB by applying it to a two‐dimensional resistivity tomography problem, which results in a remarkable enhancement of the spatial resolution. Enhancement of the resolution is also verified in the application of resistivity tomography to a field data set acquired at a tunnel construction site.",10.1190/1.1581045
Azimuth Moveout For 3-D Prestack Imaging,"We introduce a new partial prestack‐migration operator called ""azimuth moveout"" (AMO) that rotates the azimuth and modifies the offset of 3-D prestack data. Followed by partial stacking, AMO can reduce the computational cost of 3-D prestack imaging. We have successfully applied AMO to the partial stacking of a 3-D marine data set over a range of offsets and azimuths. When AMO is included in the partial‐stacking procedure, high‐frequency steeply dipping energy is better preserved than when conventional partial‐stacking methodologies are used. Because the test data set requires 3-D prestack depth migration to handle strong lateral variations in velocity, the results of our tests support the applicability of AMO to prestack depth‐imaging problems. AMO is a partial prestack‐migration operator defined by chaining a 3-D prestack imaging operator with a 3-D prestack modeling operator. The analytical expression for the AMO impulse response is derived by chaining constant‐velocity DMO with its inverse. Equivalently, it can be derived by chaining constant‐velocity prestack migration and modeling. Because 3-D prestack data are typically irregularly sampled in the surface coordinates, AMO is naturally applied as an integral operator in the time‐space domain. The AMO impulse response is a skewed saddle surface in the time‐midpoint space. Its shape depends on the amount of azimuth rotation and offset continuation to be applied to the data. The shape of the AMO saddle is velocity independent, whereas its spatial aperture is dependent on the minimum velocity. When the azimuth rotation is small (⩽20°), the AMO impulse response is compact, and its application as an integral operator is inexpensive. Implementing AMO as an integral operator is not straightforward because the AMO saddle may have a strong curvature when it is expressed in the midpoint coordinates. An appropriate transformation of the midpoint axes to regularize the AMO saddle leads to an effective implementation.",10.1190/1.1444357
The Seismovac Monopulse Pneumatic Rebound Seismic Source,"This note describes a new seismic source developed for offshore exploration. The source develops an impulse output and has the desirable feature of eliminating the secondary bubble, or oscillation, pulses characteristic of impulsive sources, permitting improved resolution of geologic features in the subbottom. The output spectrum is normally contained entirely in the useful seismic band below 100 Hz, but can be tailored by the operating parameters to yield lower or higher cutoff frequencies if desired. Optimum spectrum generation, along with the conservation of the energy normally wasted in secondary oscillations, results in high source efficiency.",10.1190/1.1440245
Rapid Forward Modeling Of Multidetector Logging-While-Drilling Sigma Measurements,"Multidetector logging-while-drilling (LWD) Sigma was introduced to the oil industry to measure neutron absorption cross section (Sigma) and radial length of invasion in shallow-invaded formations. Sigma quantifies the ability of a material to absorb thermal neutrons and is calculated from the late time portion of the time decay of thermal neutrons or gamma rays generated from thermal-neutron absorption. The assessment of invasion is made possible with the combination of a thermal-neutron detector and two gamma-ray detectors with different source-detector spacings. However, the interpretation of LWD Sigma logs is often affected by several environmental and/or geometric effects that can mask the formation response. A fast numerical simulation method embedded with inversion-based techniques can be used to estimate intrinsic formation Sigma from borehole measurements affected by shoulder-bed, invasion, and/or environmental effects. We developed a fast and accurate method to numerically simulate LWD multidetector thermal-neutron and gamma-ray time decays in realistic borehole environments. The method relies on Monte Carlo precalculated libraries of particle time decays and detector-specific flux sensitivity functions, while accounting for detector-specific borehole and diffusion effects. Simulations are benchmarked against test-pit measurements and Monte Carlo N-particle (MCNP) transport code calculations. Results indicate that multidetector time decays acquired under complex geometrical conditions can be numerically simulated in approximately 1e-5 the time required using MCNP, with average difference within two capture units. The simulation of time decays, rather than Sigma itself enables a direct relationship between actual rock Sigma and multidetector diffusion-affected time decays, thereby removing intermediate correction steps often used to convert apparent into intrinsic formation Sigma.",10.1190/geo2014-0031.1
Kirchhoff Integral Extrapolation And Migration Of Nonplanar Data,"The form of the Kirchhoff integral commonly used for migration of seismic data assumes that the observation surface is a flat, horizontal plane. This restriction is not necessary in theory or practice. A useful integral expression can be obtained for an arbitrary observation surface by use of the Kirchhoff approximation for relating the field on the observation surface to its normal derivative. Kirchhoff migration is usually carried out by an integral that represents summation over receivers for a given shot. Summation over shots is not explicitly handled. By invoking the principle of reciprocity and applying the Kirchhoff integral twice, one arrives at an integral expression that explicitly represents shot and receiver summation, contains the factors needed to compensate for nonplanar survey geometry, and can be used for wave extrapolation as well as migration. Adaptation of this integral to handling 2-D or line survey data is straightforward and, with the usual approximations concerning spherical wave spreading, it accomplishes 2-D wave extrapolation and migration. By tabulating both average and rms velocity functions, the Kirchhoff integral can be used to handle cases where the velocity changes vertically and the survey surface has vertical relief. The approximations involved are only those usually required in calculations of rms velocity traveltime. Migration is illustrated by treatment of two model data sets. One data set has shots and receivers extended horizontally with the receiver path undergoing strong elevation changes and the shot path flat. Migration of this data set illustrates the effect of the geometrical weighting factors and the effectiveness of the rms velocity approximation. The second data set is a vertical seismic profile (VSP) with shots extended horizontally and receivers extended vertically down a single well. Migration of this VSP data yields a useful image for a reasonable distance away from the well. Migration of nonplanar survey data is quite practical with geometrical artifacts that are manageable. The technique has use for surveys taken over nonplanar topography, for imaging from VSP data, and in a dual role for treatment of velocity anomalies, i.e., first as a wave extrapolation procedure to move below the anomaly and then as a migration procedure applied to the nonplanar extrapolated data.",10.1190/1.1441752
Implications Of The Fresnel-Zone Texture For Seismic Amplitude Interpretation,"The 3D reflection seismic response is associated with a zone (the Fresnel zone), rather than with a single point used in the idealized 1D convolution model. Unlike a point of incidence, the Fresnel zone is complicated by its textural characters that are defined by the dip and azimuth of microreflectors in the zone. The Fresnel-zone texture makes seismic amplitude interpretation more complicated than previously documented. A conceptual model suggests that seismic amplitude variations with offset (AVO), azimuth (AVAz), and frequency (spectral decomposition) were physically related to textural roughness, textural anisotropy, and textural scale of the Fresnel zone, respectively. Textural roughness is defined by the dip deviation of microreflectors and contributes to the AVO intercept and gradient. Textural anisotropy is defined by the degree of the preferred orientation of the microreflectors and directly affects the AVAz signature. Textural scale is defined by the spacing of the microreflectors and controls the selective frequency tuning in spectral decomposition data. The Fresnel-zone texture gives rise to amplitude variations that can not be accurately modeled by using a 1D reflectivity-wavelet convolution algorithm, and thus poses challenges to the reliability of many previous predictions of rock properties and thickness from amplitude. The AVO, AVAz, and spectral decomposition data should be used to characterize Fresnel-zone texture for predicting depositional facies, deformational fabrics, and hydraulic properties in the subsurface.",10.1190/geo2012-0023.1
Spectrum Of The Potential Field Due To Randomly Distributed Sources,"Covariance and spectral density functions of all three components of random potential fields are mutually related. The spectra of any one component on two different levels are related through an exponential function of the separation of the levels. If, starting from the earth's surface, we continue the observed random field downward, we find that at a certain level the field becomes unstable. Such a limiting depth can be estimated from the spectrum of the observed field. The spectrum of the random field is related to the spectrum of random density or intensity of magnetization. The random sources are assumed to be confined to a thin sheet or a thick, infinite sheet, or to a semi‐infinite medium. In all these cases, a relation connecting the spectrum of the random density or the intensity of magnetization and the spectrum of the random field has been established.",10.1190/1.1439933
Integrating S‐Wave Seismic‐Reflection Data And Cone Penetration Test Data Using A Multiangle Multiscale Approach,"The application of our method to the field data has uncovered a striking relation between the nature of variation of the local S‐wave velocity contrast and that of CPT cone resistance; otherwise, such a relation was not visible. Detailed analyses of two extensive field datasets have shown that the lateral fine‐scale variation of soil strength, as seen by CPT cone resistance, has a close resemblance with the variation of the local S‐wave velocity function as seen by angle‐dependent reflection measurements. This leads to a unique possibility to integrate two very different in‐situ measurements—reflection seismic and CPT—providing laterally continuous detailed information of the soil layer boundaries.",10.1190/1.1707064
3D Seismic Image Processing For Faults,"Numerous methods have been proposed to automatically extract fault surfaces from 3D seismic images, and those surfaces are often represented by meshes of triangles or quadrilaterals. However, extraction of intersecting faults is still a difficult problem that is not well addressed. Moreover, mesh data structures are more complex than the arrays used to represent seismic images, and they are more complex than necessary for subsequent processing tasks, such as that of automatically estimating fault slip vectors. We have represented a fault surface using a simpler linked data structure, in which each sample of a fault corresponded to exactly one seismic image sample, and the fault samples were linked above and below in the fault dip directions, and left and right in the fault strike directions. This linked data structure was easy to exchange between computers and facilitated subsequent image processing for faults. We then developed a method to construct complete fault surfaces without holes using this simple data structure and to extract multiple intersecting fault surfaces from 3D seismic images. Finally, we used the same structure in subsequent processing to estimate fault slip vectors and to assess the accuracy of estimated slips by unfaulting the seismic images.",10.1190/geo2015-0380.1
"Nonlinear Scattering Based Imaging In Elastic Media: Theory, Theorems, And Imaging Conditions","With the more widespread introduction of multicomponent recording devices in land and marine ocean-bottom seismic acquisition, elastic imaging may become mainstream in coming years. We have derived new, nonlinear, elastic imaging conditions. A correlation-type representation theorem for perturbed elastic media, commonly used in seismic interferometry to explain how a scattered wave response between two receivers/sources may be predicted given a boundary of sources/receivers, can be considered as a starting point for the derivation. Here, we use this theorem to derive and interpret imaging conditions for elastic migration by wavefield extrapolation (e.g., elastic reverse-time migration). Some approximations lead to a known, heuristically derived imaging condition that crosscorrelates P- and S-wave potentials that are separated in the subsurface after full-wavefield extrapolation. This formal connection reveals that the nonapproximated correlation-type representation theorem can be interpreted as a nonlinear imaging condition, that accounts also for multiply scattered and multiply converted waves, properly focusing such energy at each image point. We present a synthetic data example using either an ideal (acquisition on a full, closed boundary) or a real (partial boundary) seismic exploration survey, and we demonstrate the importance of nonlinearities in pure- and converted-mode imaging. In PP imaging, they result in better illumination and artifact reduction, whereas in PS imaging they show how zero time-lag and zero space-lag crosscorrelation imaging conditions are not ideal for imaging of converted-mode waves because no conversion arises from zero-offset experiments.",10.1190/geo2012-0286.1
"Elastic Properties Of Heavy Oil Sands: Effects Of Temperature, Pressure, And Microstructure","We have investigated the elastic properties of heavy oil sands influenced by the multiphase properties of heavy oil itself and the solid matrix with regard to temperature, pressure, and microstructure. To separately identify the role of the heavy oil and solid matrix under specific conditions, we have designed and performed special ultrasonic measurements for the heavy oil and heavy oil-saturated solids artificial samples. The measured data indicate that the viscosity of heavy oil reaches 1015  cP at the temperature of glass point, leading the heavy oil to act as a part of a solid frame of the heavy oil sand sample. The heavy oil is likely movable pore fluid accordingly once its viscosity dramatically drops to approximately 101  cP at the temperature of liquid point. The viscosity-induced elastic modulus of heavy oil in turn makes the elastic properties of heavy oil-saturated grain solid sample to be temperature dependent. In addition, the rock physics model suggests that the microstructure of heavy oil sand is transitional; consequently, the solid Gassmann equation underestimates the measured velocities at the low temperature range of the quasisolid phase of heavy oil, whereas overestimates when the temperature exceeds the liquid point. The heavy oil sand sample has a higher modulus and approaches the upper bound due to the stiffer heavy oil itself acting as a rock frame as the temperature decreases. In contrary, heavy oil sand displays a lower modulus and approaches the lower bound when the heavy oil becomes softer as the temperature goes up.",10.1190/geo2015-0351.1
Cross-Property Relations Between Electrical Conductivity And The Seismic Velocity Of Rocks,"Cross-property relations are useful when some rock properties can be measured more easily than other properties. Relations between electrical conductivity and seismic velocity, stiffness moduli, and density can be obtained by expressing the porosity in terms of those properties. There are many possible ways to combine the constitutive equations to obtain a relation, each one representing a given type of rock. The relations depend on the assumptions to obtain the constitutive equations. In the electromagnetic case, the equations involve Archie's law and its modifications for a conducting frame, the Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds, and the self-similar and complex refraction-index method (CRIM) models. In the elastic case, the stress-strain relations are mainly based on the time-average equation, the HS bounds, and the Gassmann equation. Also, expressions for dry rocks and for anisotropic media, using Backus averaging, are analyzed. The relations are applied to a shale saturated with brine (overburden) and to a sandstone saturated with oil (reservoir). Tests with sections of a North Sea well log show that the best fit is given by the relation between the Gassmann velocity and the CRIM, self-similar, and Archie models for the conductivity.",10.1190/1.2762224
Radiation From A Cylindrical Source Of Finite Length,"This paper presents the results of a theoretical study of radiation from a cylindrical source of finite length, the walls of which are subjected to symmetric lateral and tangential stresses. Three divergent wave systems are generated, P, SV, and SH, and their amplitudes are calculated in terms of the stresses operative on the walls of the ""equivalent cavity."" The zonal distribution of amplitude in the three wave systems is calculated, and the total amount of energy in each is estimated. It is shown that under the action of a lateral pressure only, an SV wave of amplitude 1.6 times the maximum amplitude of the associated P‐wave is beamed from the source in directions making angles of 45° with the axis of the source.",10.1190/1.1437923
Clay Squirt: Local Flow Dispersion In Shale-Bearing Sandstones,"Dispersion of elastic-wave velocity is common in sandstone and larger in shaly sandstone than in clean sandstone. Dispersion in fluid-saturated shaly sandstone often exceeds the level expected from the stress-dependent elastic moduli of dry sandstone. The large dispersion has been coined clay squirt and is proposed to originate from a pressure gradient between the clay microporosity and the effective porosity. We have formulated a simple model that quantifies the clay-squirt effect on bulk moduli of sandstone with homogeneously distributed shale laminae or dispersed shale. The model predictions were compared with the literature data. For sandstones with dispersed shale, agreement was found, whereas other sandstones have larger fluid-saturated bulk modulus, possibly due to partially load-bearing shales or heterogeneous shale distribution. The data that agree with the clay-squirt model indicated nonuniform pore pressure in the high-frequency regime and uniform pore pressure in the low-frequency regime. Therefore, our model showed that clay-squirt dispersion can attain a sufficient magnitude to explain much of the large dispersion observed in shaly sandstone.",10.1190/geo2015-0036.1

Compressional And Shear Arrivals In A Multipole Sonic Log,"A sound source in a liquid‐filled borehole generates, among other excitations, compressional and shear waves in the rock which are detected in the fluid as refractions. It is practical to be able to separate the latter components. I show that this can always be achieved in principle by appropriately choosing the properties of the source. Solutions of the acoustic wave equation in the ""far field"" of the source are analyzed in detail. Suppose the source radiation depends upon the azimuthal angle η through some function F(η). The refracted waves are analyzed conveniently in terms of Fourier components Fn, where n and η are Fourier conjugates. For a source symmetrical about the axis of the borehole, as conventional sources are, Fn vanishes except for n = 0. Our principal results concern the z dependence of the pressure radiation field in the drilling mud p (r, η, z) (using cylindrical polar coordinates). For a fixed n, as z → ∞, the refracted P‐wave is proportional to z-n-1 for n = 0, 1, … . The refracted S‐wave signal is proportional to z-|n-1|-1. Thus, for an axially symmetric source, the P‐wave refraction generally dominates the S‐wave refraction as z → ∞. For an axially asymmetric source the S‐wave dominates the P‐wave. An example of an n = 1 source is a horizontally pointing dipole on the borehole axis. Higher order multipole sources also effectively produce nearly pure S‐wave signals in a borehole.",10.1190/1.1441985
A Layer‐Stripping Solution Of The Inverse Problem For A One‐Dimensional Elastic Medium,"A fast algorithm for recovering profiles of density and Lamé parameters as functions of depth for the inverse seismic problem in an elastic medium is obtained. The medium is probed with planar impulsive P- and SV-waves at oblique incidence, and the medium velocity components are measured at the surface. The interconversion of P- and SV-waves defines reflection coefficients from which the medium parameter profiles are obtained recursively. The algorithm works on a layer‐stripping principle, and it is specified in both differential and recursive forms. A physical interpretation of this procedure is given in terms of a lattice filter, where the first reflections of the downgoing waves in each layer yield the various reflection coefficients for that layer. A computer run of the algorithm on the synthetic impulsive plane‐wave responses of a twenty‐layer medium shows that the algorithm works satisfactorily.",10.1190/1.1441921
Addendum To: Quantifying Resolving Power Of Seismic Systems,"The subject paper (Widess, 1982) presents a quantitative  formulation of the vertical resolving power of seismic exploration systems, and this formulation is offered as a proposed  characteristic, or standard, resolving power identified with individual systems. The present Addendum supplements the theoretical approach in the subject paper by covering some closely related practical aspects.",10.1190/1.1441449
Multiresolution Modeling And Seismic Wavefield Reconstruction In Attenuating Media,"The propagation of the seismic wavefield through a viscoelastic medium is a multiresolution process, in which depth of propagation and scale are closely associated with one another. We propose the multiresolution wavefield reconstruction (MRWR) as a means to directly integrate such concepts of scale into the backpropagation component of an imaging method. MRWR produces a reconstruction of the wavefield (at some fixed depth d), in which each scale term reconstitutes the resolution that was lost as the wavefield propagated some step‐length towards the measurement surface, away from d. Concurrently, MRWR provides a stable platform for this removal of the effects of absorption in propagation. In a multiresolution model of propagation, the viscoelastic propagation kernel is seen, mathematically, to fill the role of the scale function in multiresolution theory, as it operates on a wavefield to propagate it through some distance. The suppression of high‐resolution components of the wavefield via this scaling/propagation kernel function is readily illustrated with a simple numerical example. We use this scale‐based view of propagation and the differential inversion method to provide a physical and mathematical rationale for MRWR. Two cases of the MRWR formula are derived, and applications in one dimension and two dimensions, for synthetic data, and one field data example, are presented to demonstrate its use.",10.1190/1.1500381
Ground-Penetrating Radar Refraction Imaging With Stacked Refraction Convolution Section Method,"We have evaluated a technique initially developed for the seismic refraction imaging, the stacked refraction convolution section (SRCS), which we have properly adapted to process ground-penetrating radar (GPR) refraction data. Through a mute operation, the subsurface refracting signals, recorded by the receiver from two reciprocal sources, are selected. Following that, a velocity analysis by means of the crosscorrelation of the refracted signals and the convolution of resulting traces is performed. The refraction image in intercept times is successively derived from three main steps, namely: (1) the convolution of the subsurface refracted signals, (2) the crosscorrelation of convolved trace with the reciprocal refracted signal, and (3) the stacking of crosscorrelated traces over all source couples. The technique is not only suitable for the processing of GPR data acquired with two or more reciprocal common source profiles but it is also convenient for its low acquisition cost in addition to the simplicity of software implementation and short processing times. We have evaluated the technique on a real GPR data set to characterize a near-surface morphostructure associated with a deep-seated gravitational slope deformation affecting Mt. Watles (Upper Venosta Valley, Italy). Results of the SRCS technique were validated against the direct trenching log data up to approximately 3 m in depth and complemented by the reflection processing outputs of common-source and common-offset data acquired along the line. The SRCS and common-midpoint processing provide the best reconstruction of the subsurface morphology of a shallow basement (approximately 0.80–1.5  m depth), characterized by a velocity range of 0.070–0.119  m/ns and made of strongly to moderately weathered paragneiss. The full-wave modeling response of the reconstructed model demonstrates good agreement with the recorded signals.",10.1190/geo2015-0475.1
Simulation Of Ground‐Penetrating Radar Waves In A 2-D Soil Model,"We have developed a pseudospectral forward modeling algorithm for ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) based on an explicit solution of the 2-D lossy electromagnetic wave equation. Complex soil structures can be accommodated with heterogeneous spatial distributions of both wave velocity and electrical conductivity. This algorithm uses a Gaussian line source with uniform directivity, and there are conductive buffer regions surrounding the soil model to approximate absorbing boundary conditions. Three soil models are used to illustrate different aspects of radar wave propagation. The first model is lossless with homogeneous layers imbedded in a homogeneous background medium, the second model has the same lossless layers in a lossy background medium, and the third model is lossless and uses a nonsaturated water flow simulation to create a complex spatial velocity distribution. Two separate simulations with different source frequencies are presented for each soil model. Results indicate that higher frequency GPR will produce a sharper wavelet and can map soil layering structures with high resolution. In a conductive soil, however, higher frequencies attenuate more rapidly and the radar may not detect deeper layers.",10.1190/1.1444025
"Reservoir Characterization Using Crosswell Electromagnetic Inversion: A Feasibility Study For The Snorre Field, North Sea","The spatial resolution of a commercially available crosswell electromagnetic (EM) system is demonstrated using models derived from three time steps from a reservoir simulation of the Snorre field in the North Sea. The numerical simulation of the Snorre field waterflood shows that crosswell EM field measurements provide high sensitivity to changes in the reservoir over time. This sensitivity is achieved by combining the reservoir geometry derived from surface 3‐D seismic interpretation, reservoir conductivities at well locations, and constrained EM inversion of the reservoir's electrical conductivity. Inversions of 2‐D and 3‐D numerical models show that the changes in electrical conductivity attributable to changes in water saturation can be quantitatively mapped as a function of time. The inversions provide smooth estimates of the spatial variation of reservoir electrical conductivity that can discriminate between the level of water saturation at different stages of the waterflood. Inversions performed on 2‐D data show that for the Snorre example, 3%–5% Gaussian random noise (depending on the model) can be added without a significant degradation in the inverse models. Two‐dimensional inversions of the full 3‐D data in the Snorre example can map the vertical average electrical conductivity within the reservoir in the interwell region almost as well as when the model is two dimensional (constant in strike direction). The effect of 3‐D structure does not seriously degrade 2‐D inversion in the Snorre example‐even between wells that lie in a line parallel to structure. A series of 2‐D inversions where various constraints and starting models are used demonstrates the importance of incorporating a priori information in the form of starting models and restricting the inversion domain to the reservoir zone. These tests show that totally unconstrained, smooth inversions of the interwell volume provide very limited quantitative information. However, when the reservoir geometry is constrained by seismic data and starting models are provided by linear interpolation of conductivities at well locations, the reservoir's vertical average electrical conductivity can be predicted to within a few percent by 2‐D inversion. The snorre field consists of a full‐scale reservoir with interwell spacings that exceed 1 km where previous work has demonstrated the applicability of crosswell EM in shallow reservoirs with well separations on the order of 100 m. The simulations show that, given current transmitter and receiver technology, the magnetic fields could be measured in the Snorre field in steel‐cased wells separated from the transmitter by up to 725 m.",10.1190/1.1487064
Interpretation Techniques For A Single Frequency Airborne Electromagnetic Device,"An airborne electromagnetic device, designed to measure electromagnetic anomalies in a manner that readily lends itself to the interpretation of conductivity and type‐body, led to the Aero‐Newmont vertical coaxial coil EM system. This mining prospecting device, applicable chiefly in Canadian‐type mineral environment, is rigidly mounted on an S-55 helicopter. Continued studies in the theory of interpretation for such a device, plus an accumulation of over five years of field experience, have provided a knowledge of the limitations which compliment the interpretation procedure to produce a surprisingly accurate and useful exploration tool.",10.1190/1.1439052
Laplace-Domain Full-Waveform Inversion Of Seismic Data Lacking Low-Frequency Information,"The lack of the low-frequency information in field data prohibits the time- or frequency-domain waveform inversions from recovering large-scale background velocity models. On the other hand, Laplace-domain waveform inversion is less sensitive to the lack of the low frequencies than conventional inversions. In theory, frequency filtering of the seismic signal in the time domain is equivalent to a constant multiplication of the wavefield in the Laplace domain. Because the constant can be retrieved using the source estimation process, the frequency content of the seismic data does not affect the gradient direction of the Laplace-domain waveform inversion. We obtained inversion results of the frequency-filtered field data acquired in the Gulf of Mexico and two synthetic data sets obtained using a first-derivative Gaussian source wavelet and a single-frequency causal sine function. They demonstrated that Laplace-domain inversion yielded consistent results regardless of the frequency content within the seismic data.",10.1190/geo2011-0411.1
Electrical Analog Approach To Dipmeter Computation,"An electrical analog instrument has been developed to calculate dip and strike from continuous dipmeter logs. The particular model described is designed specifically for the Schlumberger CDM-P, or Poteclinometer, logs and it can be used with hole deviations of up to 36 degrees. Every control on this instrument corresponds to one of the recorded parameters of the dipmeter log. It is thus easy to see the effect of any one parameter on the resolved dip and strike. The instrument is portable and can therefore be used at the well site, if necessary, to make on‐the‐spot decisions regarding further drilling operation after a dipmeter log has been run. No elaborate training in procedure is required. The rapidity with which the computations can be made also permits a larger number of levels to be computed. This frequently results in more accurate information and a considerable saving in computation expense.",10.1190/1.1438773
Crosswell Seismic Imaging In A Contaminated Basalt Aquifer,"Multiple seismic crosswell surveys have been acquired and analyzed in a fractured basalt aquifer at Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Most of these surveys used a high‐frequency (1000–10,000 Hz) piezoelectric seismic source to obtain P‐wave velocity tomograms. The P‐wave velocities range from less than 3200 m/s to more than 5000 m/s. Additionally, a new type of borehole seismic source was deployed as part of the subsurface characterization program at this contaminated groundwater site. This source, known as an orbital vibrator, allows simultaneous acquisition of P‐ and S‐waves at frequencies of 100 to 400 Hz, and acquisition over larger distances. The velocity tomograms show a relationship to contaminant transport in the groundwater; zones of high contaminant concentration are coincident with zones of low velocity and high attenuation and are interpreted to be fracture zones at the boundaries between basalt flows. The orbital vibrator data show high Vp/Vs values, from 1.8 to 2.8. In spite of the lower resolution of orbital vibrator data, these data were sufficient for constraining hydrologic models at this site while achieving imaging over large interwell distances. The combination of piezoelectric data for closer well spacing and orbital vibrator data for larger well spacings has provided optimal imaging capability and has been instrumental in our understanding of the site aquifer's hydrologic properties and its scale of heterogeneity.",10.1190/1.1649371
Parametric Estimators For Current Excitation On A Thin Plate,"Parametric analysis is used to predict whether induction or current channeling dominates the current excitation in a conductive body in the earth. Knowing that one mode dominates the current response permits the use of relatively simple models that account for only a single mode of excitation in place of more complicated general ones that account for both modes of the current response. This is useful both in forward modeling and in inversion. In interpretation, predicting the current excitation is useful for verifying that the assumed mode of excitation is consistent with the interpreted body. Prediction is done with a set of ""current excitation ratios"" that we demonstrate for a thin conductive plate in a conductive half‐space. To derive the excitation ratios, parametric theory is used to estimate the strength of the inductive and galvanic modes of the current response of the plate. The ratios then follow by dividing the inductive estimate into the galvanic one. When this ratio is less than one, induction will dominate the current response. When it is greater than one, current channeling will dominate. Current excitation ratios are simple to calculate, and consist of two components. One component is a product of model parameters such as conductivity, dimension, and permeability, and can be calculated by hand. The second component consists of what we term the ""local impedance"" of the source field at the conductor. This component can be calculated with a simple half‐space or layered earth electromagnetic modeling algorithm and then contoured for later reference. The predictive capability of the current excitation ratios is tested by calculating the current response on a vertical plate in a half‐space with a full electromagnetic scattering solution. We find the correspondence between the two to be very good, and that it is possible to successfully predict the dominant mode of the current response through parametric theory where assumptions used in the parametric analysis are valid.",10.1190/1.1443290
"Application Of 3D Magnetic Amplitude Inversion To Iron Oxide-Copper-Gold Deposits At Low Magnetic Latitudes: A Case Study From Carajás Mineral Province, Brazil","Strong hydrothermal alteration modifies rock physical properties in iron oxide-copper-gold deposits (IOCGs) and may result in characteristic signatures detectable in geophysical surveys. Magnetic data are commonly used in characterizing orebodies, and 3D inversions are often used to assist in interpretations. In areas with strong remanence and self-demagnetization, the total magnetization can have directions different from the inducing field direction. This deviation precludes the use of traditional inversion methods. Magnetic amplitude inversion offers one solution to this challenge because the amplitude data are weakly dependent on the magnetization direction. In addition, the low magnetic latitude also imposes difficulty in amplitude data calculation due to the instability in the component conversion in the wavenumber domain. To formulate a practical approach, we present a case study on applying the magnetic amplitude inversion to the Furnas southeast IOCG deposit at the low magnetic latitude in Carajás Mineral Province, Brazil, and demonstrate that the approach can reliably recover an interpretable distribution of effective magnetic susceptibility and identify massive magnetite from hydrothermal alterations associated with the high-grade ore.",10.1190/geo2014-0082.1
Investigation Of Multiple Reflections And Wave Conversion By Means Of A Vertical Wave Test (Vertical Seismic Profiling) In Southern Mississippi,"A vertical wave test employing the vertical seismic profiling (VSP) technique in southern Mississippi confirmed suspicions that apparent multiple reflections might include converted waves as well as multiply reflected compressional waves. Both compressional (P) and shear (S) waves generated near the source were observed to travel to great depths, and P‐to‐S conversions were apparent in deep zones as well as shallow. P‐wave reflections were observed in agreement with predictions from synthetic records based on the sonic log. Up‐traveling P‐waves were reflected a short distance below the surface, at the base of the low‐velocity layer, and were followed as down‐traveling P‐waves to 200 ft depth by means of a vertical spread. Below 2000 ft and following the first P wave train, the predominate energy appeared to be down‐traveling P‐waves which could not be traced back to the reflection of up‐traveling P‐waves. The continuity of wavelets indicated instead that the strong down‐traveling S‐waves generated near the source produced P‐waves by S‐to‐P conversion somewhere in the zone between 800 and 1400 ft. The interference on the recordings made with an individual seismometer, or a small group of seismometers, using dynamite shots as the source was generally of a low‐frequency nature, so that the signal‐to‐noise (S/N) ratio was improved by the use of a high passband filter. The interference was greatly reduced without the need for a filter on recordings in which the source was a distributed charge of 100 ft length. The distributed charge produced much less shear‐wave energy in the P reflection band, demonstrating that the interference encountered when using a concentrated charge source was the consequence of the generation of S‐waves near the source. The distributed charges were previously chosen as a means for effectively eliminating secondary (ghost) reflections, an unwanted form of multiple reflections.",10.1190/1.1441376
The First Vertical Derivative Of Gravity,A formula is given which permits the relatively convenient calculation of the first vertical derivative of gravity in terms of the distribution of the second vertical derivative of gravity.

A Low‐Frequency Geophone For Borehole Use,"Design and performance features of a moving‐coil geophone for borehole used are described. The natural frequency is 1.2 cps and the sensitivity is 50 volts/cm/sec. Including the amplifier, the line output sensitivity is 17,000 volts/cm/sec. The input noise level of the amplifier is about 0.2 microvolt which corresponds to ground motion of about 10-8cm at one cps. A ball‐drop method of geophone calibration is described.",10.1190/1.1439146
Edge Enhancement Of Magnetic Data Using Fractional-Order-Derivative Filters,"Edge enhancement and detection techniques are fundamental operations in magnetic data interpretation. Many techniques for edge enhancement have been developed, some based on profile data and others designed for grid-based data sets. Methods that are traditionally applied to magnetic data, such as total horizontal derivative (THD) and analytic signal (AS), require the computation of integer-order horizontal and vertical derivatives of the magnetic data. However, if the data set contains features with a large variation in amplitude, then the features with small amplitudes may be difficult to outline. In addition, because most edge enhancement and detection filters are derivative-based filters, they also amplify high-frequency noise content in the data. As a result, the accuracy of derivative-based filters is restricted to data of high quality. We suggested the modification of the THD and AS filters by combining the amplitude spectra of fractional-order-derivative filters with ad hoc phase spectra, particularly designed for edge detection in magnetic data. We revealed the capability of the proposed algorithm on synthetic magnetic data and on aeromagnetic data from Turkey. Compared with the traditional use of THD and AS (with integer-order derivatives), we developed the method based on fractional-order derivatives that produced more effective results in terms of suppressing noise and delineating the edges of deep sources.",10.1190/geo2013-0473.1
Reflection Moveout And Parameter Estimation For Horizontal Transverse Isotropy,"Transverse isotropy with a horizontal axis of symmetry (HTI) is the simplest azimuthally anisotropic model used to describe fractured reservoirs that contain parallel vertical cracks. Here, I present an exact equation for normal‐moveout (NMO) velocities from horizontal reflectors valid for pure modes in HTI media with any strength of anisotropy. The azimuthally dependent P‐wave NMO velocity, which can be obtained from 3-D surveys, is controlled by the principal direction of the anisotropy (crack orientation), the P‐wave vertical velocity, and an effective anisotropic parameter equivalent to Thomsen's coefficient δ. An important parameter of fracture systems that can be constrained by seismic data is the crack density, which is usually estimated through the shear‐wave splitting coefficient γ. The formalism developed here makes it possible to obtain the shear‐wave splitting parameter using the NMO velocities of P and shear waves from horizontal reflectors. Furthermore, γ can be estimated just from the P‐wave NMO velocity in the special case of the vanishing parameter ε, corresponding to thin cracks and negligible equant porosity. Also, P‐wave moveout alone is sufficient to constrain γ if either dipping events are available or the velocity in the symmetry direction is known. Determination of the splitting parameter from P‐wave data requires, however, an estimate of the ratio of the P‐to‐S vertical velocities (either of the split shear waves can be used). Velocities and polarizations in the vertical symmetry plane of HTI media, that contains the symmetry axis, are described by the known equations for vertical transverse isotropy (VTI). Time‐related 2-D P‐wave processing (NMO, DMO, time migration) in this plane is governed by the same two parameters (the NMO velocity from a horizontal reflector and coefficient ε) as in media with a vertical symmetry axis. The analogy between vertical and horizontal transverse isotropy makes it possible to introduce Thomsen parameters of the ""equivalent"" VTI model, which not only control the azimuthally dependent NMO velocity, but also can be used to reconstruct phase velocity and carry out seismic processing in off‐symmetry planes.",10.1190/1.1444170
Multichannel Estimate Of The Seismic Wavelet,"One of the fundamental problems in exploration seismology is to obtain a seismic record which has both high resolution and high ratio of signal to noise. If the seismic trace has a fair signal‐to‐noise (S/N) ratio, then subsequent data processing can be applied to improve the resolution. Basically, this data‐processing technique is the deconvolution of the source wavelet from the field seismic traces.",10.1190/1.1442136
Orthorhombic Media: Modeling Elastic Wave Behavior In A Vertically Fractured Earth,"Vertical fractures and horizontal fine layering combine to form a long, wavelength equivalent orthorhombic medium. Such media constitute a subset of the set of all orthorhombic media. Orthorhombic elastic symmetry is the lowest symmetry for which the slowness surface (the solution of the Christoffel equation) is bicubic rather sextic. Various properties of orthorhombic media, such as the number and location of conical points and longitudinal directions, may be derived from the slowness surface or, because of its bicubic character, the squared slowness surface, which is a cubic  surface. From the occurrence and angular orientation of some of these distinctive features, conclusions can be drawn with respect to the properties of the medium and to the parameters of the assumed underlying causes of the anisotropy. The estimation of these more subtle properties gains greater importance with the proliferation of multiazimuthal seismic surveys and the ability to drill along ever more complicated 3‐D well trajectories.",10.1190/1.1444297
A Transparent Boundary Technique For Numerical Modeling Of Elastic Waves,"In numerical modeling of wave motions, strong reflections from artificial model boundaries may contaminate or mask true reflections from the interior model interfaces. Hence, developing a kind of exterior model boundary transparent to the outgoing waves is of critical importance. Among proposed solutions, e.g., Smith (1974), Kausel and Tassoulas (1981), and Higdon (1991), the most widely used may be the Clayton and Engquist (1977) method of absorbing boundary conditions, based on paraxial approximations for acoustic and elastic‐wave equations. However, absorbing boundary conditions make the reflection coefficients zero only for normal incidence, and suppression of reflected S-waves (Clayton and Engquist, 1977) becomes poorer as the ratio of P- to S-wave velocity (Vp/Vs) becomes larger.",10.1190/1.1444604
"Exploration Beneath Volcanics: Snake River Plain, Idaho","Coincident gravity, magnetotelluric (MT), and seismic reflection‐refraction surveys were conducted along a line traversing the boundary between the volcanic‐covered Eastern Snake River plain, Idaho, and the sediment‐covered Western overthrust belt, One‐dimensional MT and seismic refraction analysis away from the immediate boundary between sediments and volcanics successfully maps the depths to units of igneous and sedimentary—or metasedimentary—rock. Substantially different models of the volcanic‐covered terrain and of the sediment‐covered terrain are linked by a gravity anomaly and by an elongation and rotation of MT anisotropy ellipses which indicate a fault. Fault dip, depth extent, and motion are constrained by marked changes in the first‐arrival apparent velocities and by an electrical marker layer. The analysis shows that metasediments extend laterally at least 16 km beneath the volcanic cover. The two terrains are connected by a boundary zone which is a major normal fault.",10.1190/1.1442476
Can We Image Complex Structures With First‐Arrival Traveltime?,"We experienced difficulties when attempting to perform seismic imaging in complex velocity fields using prestack Kirchhoff depth migration in conjunction with traveltimes computed by finite‐differencing the eikonal equation. The problem arose not because of intrinsic limitations of Kirchhoff migration, but rather from the failure of finite‐differencing to compute traveltimes representative of the energetic part of the wavefield. Further analysis showed that the first arrival is most often associated with a marginally energetic event wherever subsequent arrivals exist. The consequence is that energetic seismic events are imaged with a kinematically incorrect operator and turn out mispositioned at depth. We therefore recommend that first‐arrival traveltime fields, such as those computed by finite‐differencing the eikonal equation, be used in Kirchhoff migration only with great care when the velocity field hosts multiple transmitted arrivals; such a situation is typically met where geological structure creates strong and localized velocity heterogeneities, which partition the incident and reflected wavefields into multiple arrivals; in such an instance, imaging cannot be strictly considered a kinematic process, as it must be performed with explicit reference to the relative amplitudes of multiple arrivals.",10.1190/1.1443439
Zeroth‐Order Asymptotics: Waveform Inversion Of The Lowest Degree,"Sensitivity computation is an integral part of many waveform inversion algorithms. An accurate and efficient technique for sensitivity computation follows from the zero‐order asymptotic solution to the elastodynamic equation of motion. Given the particular form of the asymptotic solution, we show that perturbations in high‐frequency waveforms are primarily sensitive to perturbations in phase. The resulting expression for waveform sensitivity is the time derivative of the synthetic seismogram multiplied by the phase sensitivity. All of the necessary elements for a step in the waveform inversion algorithm result from a single forward simulation. A comparison with sensitivities calculated using a purely numerical perturbation technique demonstrates that zero‐order sensitivities are accurate. Based upon the methodology, we match 330 waveforms from a crosswell experiment at a bacterial transport site near Oyster, Virginia. Each iteration of the waveform inversion takes approximately 18 minutes of CPU time on a workstation, illustrating the efficiency of the approach.",10.1190/1.1567231
The Calculation Of Magnetotelluric Quantities For Three‐Dimensional Conductivity Inhomogeneities,"Three‐dimensional numerical modeling is applied to magnetotelluric principal axis and tipper analysis. Calculations of the impedance, rotation angles, and tipper azimuths are made at the surface of a conducting half‐space which contains perturbed two‐dimensional models. The object is to determine which of the directions is less disturbed by the perturbations, and hence is the more reliable guide to probable strike direction. The results indicate that the principal axis direction is a marginally more stable indicator of strike direction than is the tipper azimuth.",10.1190/1.1440886
3-D Broad‐Band Estimates Of Reflector Dip And Amplitude,"Estimates of seismic coherence of 3-D data sets have provided a radically new way of delineating detailed structural and stratigraphic features. Covariance matrices provide the natural formalism to extend the original three‐trace crosscorrelation algorithm to larger analysis windows containing multiple traces, thus providing greater fidelity in low signal‐to‐noise environments. By use of 3-D phase compensation using Radon transforms, we exploit advances made in the high‐resolution multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithms, originally developed for the defense industry. All three families of multitrace attributes (coherence, amplitude, and phase) are coupled through the underlying geology, such that we obtain three families of complimentary images of geologic features that result in lateral changes in wave form. The phase attributes of dip/azimuth and curvature allow us to image areas that have undergone folding or draping that can not be seen on coherence or amplitude images. The amplitude attributes allow us to image oil/water contacts or other areas of amplitude variation that may not be seen on coherence or dip/azimuth images. Coupled with coherence and the conventional seismic data, these new multitrace dip and amplitude data cubes can greatly accelerate the interpretation of the major features of large 3-D data volumes. At the reservoir scale, they will be of significant help in delineation of subtle internal variations of lithology, porosity, and diagenesis. In computer‐assisted interpretation, we strongly feel these new attributes will become the building blocks for the application of modern texture analysis and segmentation algorithms to the delineation of geologic features.",10.1190/1.1444721
Effects Of Averaging And Sampling On The Statistics Of Reflection Coefficients,"The reflection coefficients derived from sonic and density logs are frequently used in seismic exploration. Even though they measure the in‐situ formation slowness and density, sonic and density tools do not measure the exact, continuous formation properties but locally averaged properties sampled at discrete depth points. Furthermore, the logs are frequently reinterpolated to form a Goupillaud medium for many applications such as synthetic seismogram computation. Both the logging tools and the Goupillaud interpolation introduce averaging and sampling effects into the reflection coefficients and significantly alter the autocorrelation of the reflection coefficient sequence. Analytical formulas are derived to show how the autocorrelation is altered and to calculate how the autocorrelation depends on the averaging and sampling intervals. Essentially, these effects impose sincsquared envelopes on the power spectrum of the reflection coefficient sequence and alias high‐frequency components to low‐frequency components in the spectral domain. These findings are verified using synthetic and real examples.",10.1190/1.1442957
Technique For Improved Convergence In Iterative Analysis Of Gravity Anomaly Profiles,Narrow two‐dimensional gravity anomalies are difficult to interpret iteratively by the relatively simple flat‐plate method suggested by Bott (1960) and employed by others. In this report Bott's formula is modified empirically after a number of iterations have proceeded. The process is repeated until satisfactory convergence is obtained. The results can be applied to other profiles across the anomaly of interest and thus save substantial computer time by requiring fewer iterations. The technique is applied to two Bouguer anomaly profiles. Analysis of adjoining anomaly profile data with similar amplitudes and widths can be used to speed the convergence in the iterative modeling process.,10.1190/1.1440355
Investigating The Velocity‐Depth Ambiguity Of Reflection Traveltimes,"Reflection seismic data contain a long wavelength ambiguity making it difficult to separate traveltime information into velocity and reflector depth components. The existence of this velocity‐depth ambiguity is a feature of the geometry of the subsurface and is not caused by the particular inversion algorithm being used. Factors that control the occurrence of velocity‐depth ambiguities include the effective width of a potential velocity anomaly; i.e., its spatial wavelength, its height above a reflector, and its thickness. Factors that do not affect velocity‐depth ambiguities are the magnitude of the anomaly (the difference in velocity between it and the background) and the cable length with which data were recorded. A thin velocity anomaly induces an ambiguity at a wavelength approximately equal to 4.44 times the height of the anomaly above the reflector. A thick anomaly that spans the entire space from surface to reflector induces an ambiguity at a wavelength approximately equal to 2.57 the depth to the reflector. These are wavelengths that are significant in size, and therefore are of exploration interest. Through Fourier analysis, any subsurface velocity field can be decomposed into spatial frequency components. Thus the wavelength dependent velocity‐depth ambiguity adversely affects all velocity distributions.",10.1190/1.1443563
"""Geophysical Prospecting,"" Reports On Progress In Physics, Vol. Ii, Pp. 97–128. By E. Lancaster‐Jones. Published By The Physical Society, London (1936).","This chapter on Geophysical Prospecting is a brief summary of the methods most commonly used in applied geophysics at the present time. It is mostly descriptive in content, although some elementary theoretical matters are discussed, and, in a few cases, brief historical remarks are made.

Crosswell Traveltime Tomography In Three Dimensions,"Our velocity parameterization is quite different from pixelized models, so resolution properties will be different. Using wave‐modeled synthetic data, we find that near horizontal raypaths have the largest mismatch between ray‐traced traveltimes and traveltimes estimated from the data. In conventional tomography, horizontal raypaths are essential for high vertical resolution. With our model, however, the highest resolution and most accurate inversions are achieved by excluding raypaths that travel nearly parallel to the geologic layering. We perform this exclusion in both a static and model‐based manner. We apply our 3‐D method to a multiple‐profile crosswell survey at the Cymric oil field in California, an area of very steep structural dips and significant well trajectory deviations. Results of this multiple‐profile 3‐D tomography correlate very well with the independently‐processed single profile results, with the advantage of an improved tie at the common well.",10.1190/1.1484529
"3-D Two‐Point Ray Tracing For Heterogeneous, Weakly Transversely Isotropic Media","A two‐point ray‐tracing technique for 3-D smoothly heterogeneous, weakly transversely isotropic media is based on Fermat's principle and takes advantage of global Chebyshev approximation of both the model and curved rays. This approximation gives explicit relations for derivatives of traveltime with respect to ray parameters and allows use of the rapidly converging conjugate gradient method to compute traveltimes. The method is fast because, for most smoothly heterogeneous media, approximation of rays by only a few polynomials and a few conjugate gradient iterations provide excellent precision in traveltime calculation.",10.1190/1.1444103
Method For Calculating The Fracture Porosity Of Tight-Fracture Reservoirs,"Identifying fractures and evaluating the parameters of tight reservoirs are important problems. Developing methods to accurately interpret logging data for tight sandstone and shale reservoirs is of great significance, especially when only conventional logging data can be obtained. Identifying natural fractures with limited available data is challenging. Comparing and analyzing the log response characteristics of the natural fracture zone of a tight reservoir indicate that acoustic (AC) and density (DEN) data are highly sensitive to fractures in tight reservoirs. First, we have obtained the characteristics and differences of the log response of natural fractures. Second, we established a model that is based on these sensitive log-response characteristics (AC and DEN) to identify fractures (correlation coefficient method with window lengths), and we analyzed the cut-off of the correlation coefficient. Then, we established a model (the revised Wyllie difference method) to characterize the fracture porosity based on the difference in the sensitive log responses of the fracture (the difference in the AC and DEN curves). Finally, we applied this methodology to a case study of a tight reservoir in the Sichuan Basin, China, and the AC-DEN correlation coefficient and fracture porosity are calculated. The AC-DEN correlation coefficient adequately identifies fractures, and the calculated fracture porosity is consistent with the fracture porosity from full borehole microresistivity imaging. Thus, this method is applicable to evaluating fractures in tight-fracture reservoirs.",10.1190/geo2015-0434.1
Reducing Source‐Generated Noise In Shallow Seismic Data Using Linear And Hyperbolic Τ‐P Transformations,"High‐resolution seismic reflection data recorded at many locations on the earth are plagued by the overwhelming effects of direct, refracted, guided, and surface waves. These different components of source‐generated noise may completely mask reflections at traveltimes ∼50–100 ms. Conventional processing methods that include the time‐consuming application of mute functions may lead to the misprocessing of source‐generated noise (especially guided waves) as reflected events and/or the unintentional removal of important shallow reflections. We introduce a combined linear and hyperbolic τ‐p processing scheme that results in the effective separation of reflections from source‐generated noise. After applying linear moveout terms that adjust the direct, refracted, and guided arrivals to appear horizontal to subhorizontal, the reduced traveltime shot gathers are transformed into the linear τ‐p domain. It is then straightforward to design a single τ‐p filter that eliminates most of the source‐generated noise throughout the entire data set. Following inverse linear τ‐p transformation and removal of the linear moveout terms, the filtered shot gathers contain reflections and residual elements of the source‐generated noise. Because summing along hyperbolas favors reflections, transforming the filtered shot gathers into the hyperbolic τ‐p domain leads to significant enhancements in the S/N ratio. A simple rescaling of data values in the hyperbolic τ‐p domain, which results in the loss of true amplitude information, increases further the relative strength of the reflected signals. Finally, inverse hyperbolic transformation yields shot gathers dominated by reflections. In tests of the combined τ‐p processing scheme on a synthetic shot gather and on a complete shallow seismic reflection data set recorded in northern Switzerland, significant improvements in the quality of reflections in the prestacked data and on a fully processed section are readily apparent. According to the results of these tests, the new scheme works well for reflections originating from flat and dipping horizons.",10.1190/1.1487106
Two Selected Field Examples Of Em Anomalies In A Conductive Environment,"In a previous paper (Lajoie and West, 1976), the authors described a computer modeling study demonstrating the effects of conductive overburden and host rocks in the interpretation of electromagnetic surveys. In conductive environments, field results may differ substantially from that predicted by free‐air modeling. This is not to say that free‐air modeling data cannot be used in the interpretation process, but that caution must be exercised and that an understanding of the physical processes involved can lead to a more accurate interpretation with resultant savings in exploration expenditures. In this short note, two field examples are presented to illustrate some of the concepts presented in our previous paper.",10.1190/1.1440735
Resolving Refractor Ambiguities With Amplitudes,"Amplitudes are used to constrain refraction models. This study demonstrates that the refraction time section generated through the convolution of forward and reverse refraction traces together with a static shift facilitates the convenient recognition of amplitude variations related to changes in refractor wavespeed. For large contrasts in wavespeeds between the upper layer and the refractor, the head coefficient is approximately proportional to the ratio of the specific acoustic impedances. Since the convolution operation effectively multiplies the amplitudes of the forward and reverse arrivals, the convolved amplitudes are proportional to the square of this ratio. In general, the higher the contrast in the refractor wavespeed and/or density, the lower the amplitude. The regions recognized in the wavespeed analysis function correlate with those determined with amplitudes, thereby providing an additional constraint on inversion with model‐based approaches.",10.1190/1.1487104
The Vertical Array In Reflection Seismology—Some Experimental Studies,"There are several advantages in using vertical arrays for recording reflected signal. Signal‐to‐noise ratio can be controlled to any desired level when the noise is due to scattering from layers shallower than the depth to the array. By the use of vertical arrays, the band width of useable seismic energy can be increased, events can be properly identified, the signal that eventually produces near surface induced multiples can be measured, as well as the direct pulse radiated from the source and its accompanying ghosts. A field test documents these predictions.",10.1190/1.1440612

Integration Of Geophysical Constraints For Multilayer Geometry Refinements In 2.5D Gravity Inversion,"We have explored the feasibility of estimating depths of multiple interfaces from gravity data. The strata are simulated by an aggregate of 3D rectangular prisms whose bottom depths are parameters to be estimated. In the inversion process, we have integrated geophysical constraints including the borehole information and the sharp condition described by the total variation function. The iterative residual function is also introduced to adjust the weighting of the estimated parameters so that layers of different depths have nearly equal likelihood for deviation. The inversion is processed by minimizing the Tikhonov parametric functional by the reweighted regularized conjugate gradient method. Inequality constraints are adopted to deal with the coupling of the interfaces. Synthetic tests show that such integration is conducive to restoring the multilayer depth distribution. Real data applications in Mariana confirm that the inversion method is effective in complex geologic settings in practice. We have also evaluated several issues that specifically deserve attention for obtaining satisfactory results in multilayer gravity inversion.",10.1190/geo2015-0565.1
"Radio Tomography And Borehole Radar Delineation Of The Mcconnell Nickel Sulfide Deposit, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada","In an effort to reduce costs and increase revenues at mines, there is a strong incentive to develop high‐resolution techniques both for near‐mine exploration and for delineation of known orebodies. To investigate the potential of high‐frequency EM techniques for exploration and delineation of massive sulfide orebodies, radio frequency electromagnetic (RFEM) and ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were conducted in boreholes through the McConnell massive nickel‐copper sulfide body near Sudbury, Ontario, from 1993–1996. Crosshole RFEM data were acquired with a JW-4 electric dipole system between two boreholes on section 2720W. Ten frequencies between 0.5 and 5.0 MHz were recorded. Radio signals propagated through the Sudbury Breccia over ranges of at least 150 m at all frequencies. The resulting radio absorption tomogram clearly imaged the McConnell deposit over 110 m downdip. Signal was extinguished when either antenna entered the sulfide body. However, the expected radio shadow did not eventuate when transmitter and receiver were on opposite sides of the deposit. Two‐dimensional modeling suggested that diffraction around the edges of the sulfide body could not account for the observed field amplitudes. It was concluded at the time that the sulfide body is discontinuous; according to modeling, a gap as small as 5 m could have explained the observations. Subsequent investigations by INCO established that pick‐up in the metal‐cored downhole cables was actually responsible for the elevated signal levels. Both single‐hole reflection profiles and crosshole measurements were acquired using RAMAC borehole radar systems, operating at 60 MHz. Detection of radar reflections from the sulfide contact was problematic. One coherent reflection was observed from the hanging‐wall contact in single‐hole reflection mode. This reflection could be traced about 25 m uphole from the contact. In addition to unfavorable survey geometry, factors which may have suppressed reflections included host rock heterogeneity, disseminated sulfides, and contact irregularity. Velocity and absorption tomograms were generated in the Sudbury Breccia host rock from the crosshole radar. Radar velocity was variable, averaging 125 m/μs, while absorption was typically 0.8 dB/m at 60 MHz. Kirchhoff‐style 2-D migration of later arrivals in the crosshole radargrams defined reflective zones that roughly parallel the inferred edge of the sulfide body. The McConnell high‐frequency EM surveys established that radio tomography and simple radio shadowing are potentially valuable for near‐ and in‐mine exploration and orebody delineation in the Sudbury Breccia. The effectiveness of borehole radar in this particular environment is less certain.",10.1190/1.1444876
Integrated Wide‐Angle And Near‐Vertical Subbasalt Study Using Large‐Aperture Seismic Data From The Faeroe—Shetland Region,"Acquiring large‐aperture seismic data (38 km maximum offset) along a profile crossing the Faeroe—Shetland basin in the North Atlantic enables us to use wide‐angle reflections and refractions, in addition to conventional streamer data (0–6 km), for subbasalt imaging. The wide‐angle results are complemented and confirmed by images obtained from the conventional near‐vertical‐offset range. Traveltime tomography applied to the wide‐angle data shows a low‐velocity layer (3.5–4.5 km/s) underneath southeastward‐thinning lava flows, suggesting a 2.5–3.0‐km‐thick sedimentary layer. The velocity model obtained from traveltime tomography is used to migrate wide‐angle reflections from large offsets that arrive ahead of the water‐wave cone. The migrated image shows base‐basalt and sub—basalt reflections that are locally coincident with the tomographic boundaries. Application of a new multiple suppression technique and controlled stacking of the conventional streamer data produces seismic sections consistent with the wide‐angle results. Prestack depth migration of the near‐vertical offsets shows a continuous base‐basalt reflection and a clearly defined termination of the basalt flows.",10.1190/1.1487079
Precise Measurement Of Deep Electrical Anomalies,"A method of electrical prospecting has been developed in which the deleterious effects of superficial inhomogeneities in resistivity are eliminated. An electrode configuration is used consisting of a current electrode at ""infinity,"" a pair of current electrodes with a constant separation of a few hundred feet which are used alternately, and a pair of potential electrodes with a constant separation of a few hundred feet, collinear with the pair of current electrodes, and at a distance from them which is varied to secure depth resolution. It is demonstrated that superficial influences are eliminated by forming the resistivity increment, the ratio between apparent resistivity determined by use of the closer current electrode of the alternate pair and that determined by use of the farther current electrode of the alternate pair. It is also demonstrated that the area explored is below a point approximately half‐way between the alternate pair of current electrodes. Resistivity increment curves, called Resistologs by the authors, can be correlated from station to station, and after they are correlated the lateral variation in the electrical properties of selected subsurface zones can be studied. As a result of the latter characteristic of the measurements, a possibility exists for the direct location of oil and gas, observational evidence for which is presented. The results of surveys made in Hart County, Kentucky, and in the Sam Fordyce, Seven Sisters, Pettus, Branyon, Dunlap, Oakville, and Rhode Ranch fields of Southwest Texas are displayed.",10.1190/1.1445089
Heavy Oil Sands Measurement And Rock-Physics Modeling,"Heavy oil reservoirs are important alternative energy resources to conventional oil and gas reservoirs. However, due to the high viscosity of heavy oil, much production of heavy oil reservoirs involves injecting steam, and determining the temperature distribution is significant for production. To do this, time-lapse inversion is commonly used to derive the change of the oil sand properties during steam injection, and rock-physics models are used to link the properties and temperature. Many people have done research on simulating variations of the oil sand properties with temperature; however, the previous models fail to adequately represent our experimental data, and they overestimate their values. The errors between previous models' predictions and measurements are quite large, especially at low temperatures. To study the oil sand properties, we first measured eight oil sand samples including five presteam samples and three poststeam samples, and we experimentally quantified the pressure sensitivity of velocity, the temperature sensitivity of velocity, and the corresponding VP/VS ratios. Then we developed a new model, introducing a frame damage parameter and a solid oil proportion parameter. This model integrates the solid oil into the sand frame, and it incorporates the temperature-dependent frame damage to characterize the frame moduli variations with increasing temperature. The solid-Gassmann equation was then applied to saturate the sands' frame with heavy oil. Our simulation results determined that the errors at low temperature and high temperature were both compensated, and the new model fitted better than previous models over the whole measurement temperature range. The modeling was also extended to the thermal production temperature range, and the phase transition of water was considered, which provided a useful indicator of the steam.",10.1190/geo2014-0573.1
Improved Estimates Of Seismic Curvature And Flexure Based On 3D Surface Rotation In The Presence Of Structure Dip,"Fracture characterization is critical to reliable prediction of fractured reservoirs. Fractures formed by folding and/or shearing of reservoir formations, can be detected using seismic curvature and flexure analysis. Previous curvature and flexure analysis methods often have limitations in accuracy and efficiency in the presence of structural dip. We have developed new algorithms for volumetric curvature and flexure analysis based on 3D surface rotation using the local reflector dip to improve the accuracy and efficiency for curvature and flexure analysis in structurally complex settings. Among the various measures of curvature and flexure in 3D space, we have focused on signed maximum curvature and flexure that are considered to be most effective for predicting intensity and orientation of faults and fractures in fractured reservoirs. The application of the algorithms to a 3D seismic survey from Teapot Dome (Wyoming) demonstrated that the new methods help resolve subtle structural details that are otherwise not easily discernible from regular amplitude and conventional attributes, thus enhancing our capability to visualize and understand the structural complexity of fractured reservoirs.",10.1190/geo2015-0258.1
Interface Prediction Ahead Of The Excavation Front By The Tunnel-Seismic-While-Drilling (Tswd) Method,"Predicting geologic interfaces ahead of a tunnel front is of major importance when boring tunnels. Unexpected variations in ground properties can cause problems for tunnel-boring advance and risk for human safety. The tunnel-seismic-while-drilling (TSWD) method utilizes noise produced during mechanical excavation to obtain interpretable seismic data. This passive method uses accelerometers mounted on the advancing tunnel-boring machine (reference signals) together with seismic sensors located along and outside the tunnel. Data recorded by fixed sensors are crosscorrelated with the reference signal and sorted by offset. Similar to reverse vertical seismic profiling, crosscorrelated TSWD data are processed to extract the reflected wavefield. During mechanical excavation of a   950-m   tunnel through upper Triassic dolomite, a survey was performed to predict geologic interfaces. Faults intersecting the tunnel were observed on seismic TSWD data and later were confirmed by geostructural inspection. P- and S-wave interval velocities obtained by TSWD data along the bored tunnel were used to compute dynamic rock moduli to support tunnel completion.",10.1190/1.2740712
Fixed-Source And Fixed-Receiver Walkaway Seismic Noise Tests: A Field Comparison,"Seismologists and geophysical literature often use the term ""walkaway"" to describe any survey used to analyze wavetrains based on source-to-receiver offset. A distinction should be made between receiver-group moveout (fixed-source walkaway) and source moveout (fixed-receiver walkaway) when multiple channels simultaneously record signal from multiple independent geophones. Three data sets are presented that illustrate this distinction: one collected in an area where a fixed-receiver walkaway survey recorded similar data and was more time efficient than a fixed-source walkaway survey, and two others collected in an area where dipping reflectors and laterally varying velocities caused the fixed-receiver walkaway data to be significantly different than the fixed-source walkaway data. The results show that, while still useful, clarity in recorded data is lost when fixed-receiver walkaway surveys are substituted for fixed-source walkaway surveys in areas with uneven surface topography, dipping interfaces, or laterally varying velocities. This is because walkaway seismograms are displayed by source-to-receiver offset, whereas neighboring traces do not correspond necessarily with neighboring raypaths or reflection points.",10.1190/1.2337573
Cancellation Of Multiple Harmonic Noise Series In Geophysical Records,"Cancellation of harmonic noise has been essential in our research to uncover seismoelectric signals that are often completely masked by powerline noise.

An Efficient Data‐Subspace Inversion Method For 2-D Magnetotelluric Data,"There are currently three types of algorithms in use for regularized 2-D inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) data. All seek to minimize some functional which penalizes data misfit and model structure. With the most straight‐forward approach (exemplified by OCCAM), the minimization is accomplished using some variant on a linearized Gauss‐Newton approach. A second approach is to use a descent method [e.g., nonlinear conjugate gradients (NLCG)] to avoid the expense of constructing large matrices (e.g., the sensitivity matrix). Finally, approximate methods [e.g., rapid relaxation inversion (RRI)] have been developed which use cheaply computed approximations to the sensitivity matrix to search for a minimum of the penalty functional. Approximate approaches can be very fast, but in practice often fail to converge without significant expert user intervention. On the other hand, the more straightforward methods can be prohibitively expensive to use for even moderate‐size data sets. Here, we present a new and much more efficient variant on the OCCAM scheme. By expressing the solution as a linear combination of rows of the sensitivity matrix smoothed by the model covariance (the ""representers""), we transform the linearized inverse problem from the M-dimensional model space to the N-dimensional data space. This method is referred to as DASOCC, the data space OCCAM's inversion. Since generally N ≪ M, this transformation by itself can result in significant computational saving. More importantly the data space formulation suggests a simple approximate method for constructing the inverse solution. Since MT data are smooth and ""redundant,"" a subset of the representers is typically sufficient to form the model without significant loss of detail. Computations required for constructing sensitivities and the size of matrices to be inverted can be significantly reduced by this approximation. We refer to this inversion as REBOCC, the reduced basis OCCAM's inversion. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data sets with REBOCC, DASOCC, NLCG, RRI, and OCCAM show that REBOCC is faster than both DASOCC and NLCG, which are comparable in speed. All of these methods are significantly faster than OCCAM, but are not competitive with RRI. However, even with a simple synthetic data set, we could not always get RRI to converge to a reasonable solution. The basic idea behind REBOCC should be more broadly applicable, in particular to 3-D MT inversion.",10.1190/1.1444778
Uranium Assay Logging Using A Pulsed 14‐Mev Neutron Source And Detection Of Delayed Fission Neutrons,"An in‐situ uranium assay logging system has been developed that measures directly and quantitatively the uranium concentration in the formation surrounding a drill hole. System operation is based on the DFN (delayed fission neutron) method which involves (1) bombarding a formation with short duration bursts of neutrons from a pulsed‐neutron generator to induced fission in any uranium present; (2) separating delayed fission neutrons, from source and prompt fission neutrons, by waiting a few milliseconds after each neutron burst before activating the neutron counter system; (3) deactivating the neutron counter system before the beginning of the next neutron burst; and (4) repeating this bombard‐wait‐count cycle a sufficient number of times to accumulate a statistically acceptable number of the delayed neutron counts. The DFN logging method has been used routinely in our field operations for several years, and it has successfully overcome one of the most perplexing problems encountered in uranium exploration and production—that of radioactive disequilibrium. The need for coring and chemical assaying is virtually eliminated. The information provided by chemical assay of cores is made available by DFN assays on site and in minutes after the data are accumulated. The disequilibrium ratio is available to the field geologist immediately by comparing DFN assay ore grade to ore grade from a calibrated natural gamma‐ray log. A DFN uranium assay logging system is capable of 8 ft/minute continuous semiquantitative logs and stationary quantitative assays. Calibration procedures and a method for correcting DFN assays for variable formation parameters, such as porosity and macroscopic absorption cross‐section, have been developed. DFN logs, assays, and chemical assays of cores are in excellent agreement.",10.1190/1.1440627
Uncertainty Of Linear Earthquake Site Amplification Via Bayesian Inversion Of Surface Seismic Data,"We examine uncertainty in predicted linear 1D site amplification due to uncertainty in shear-wave velocity (VS) structure quantified from Bayesian (probabilistic) inversion of microtremor array dispersion data. Based on a sample of VS profiles drawn from the posterior probability density of the microtremor inversion, probability distributions are computed for common predictors of site amplification including VSZ (traveltime average VS to a depth z) and amplification spectra based on seismic impedance variations and full transverse shear-wave effects. These methods are applicable for any site, but the resulting probabilistic site amplification analyses are specific to the two sediment sites studied here with strongly contrasting geology in high population centers of British Columbia, Canada. The site amplification probability distributions for the two sites are shown to be more informative than amplification estimated for a single best-fit VS profile by characterizing the uncertainty and therefore level of confidence in the predictions. The shear-wave amplification probability spectra are evaluated by comparison to empirical earthquake and microtremor spectral ratios, with generally good agreement in resonant peak frequencies and amplification levels, providing confidence that the primary influence of site-specific structure is accounted for appropriately. The wider implication here is that proper characterization of the VS(z) profile uncertainty distribution from inversion of cost-effective surface wave dispersion data is beneficial in the application of said profiles to the prediction of earthquake site response and its uncertainty, as required for probabilistic seismic hazard assessment.",10.1190/geo2012-0345.1
Vibroseis Refraction Weathering Techniques,"In general, Vibroseis® field techniques that are optimum for reflection mapping are the worst possible for recording the ""first‐break"" times needed for refraction weathering calculations. The purpose of this paper is to describe linearly swept frequency (LSF) vibratory field procedures for enhancing Vibroseis refraction data. The resulting optimum refraction techniques are contrasted with optimum reflection techniques and a few examples of the refraction results are shown.",10.1190/1.1440339
Modeling The Electrical Conductivity Of Hydrogeological Strata Using Joint-Inversion Of Loop-Loop Electromagnetic Data,"In coastal-estuarine agricultural landscapes that are inherently rich in sulfidic sediments and saline water-tables, natural resource management data need to be collected to describe the heterogeneous nature of the soil, underlying regolith, and interactions with groundwater. Geophysical methods, such as electromagnetic (EM) induction instruments, are increasingly being used. This is because they measure apparent soil electrical conductivity σa-mS/m, which has previously been successfully used to map the areal distribution of soil (e.g., salinity) and hydrological (e.g., water-table depth) properties. We explored the potential of a next-generation DUALEM-421 and EM34 to be used independently and in conjunction with each other to provide information we can use to represent the pedological and hydrogeological setting of alluvial and estuarine sediments. A 1D laterally constrained joint-inversion algorithm can account for the nonlinearity of large σa (i.e., 100  mS/m). We applied this algorithm to develop 2D cross sections of electrical conductivity (σ-mS/m) from DUALEM-421 and EM34 σa data acquired across an estuarine landscape and situated within Quaternary fluvial sediments adjacent to Rocky Mouth Creek on the far north coast of New South Wales, Australia. We compared this joint-inversion model with inversions of the DUALEM-421 and EM34 σa data independently of each other. For the most part, the general patterns of the inverted models of σ compare favorably with existing pedological and hydrogeological interpretations, based on results achieved during a previous geoelectrical survey. However, the joint-inversion provides a more realistic model of the location and extent of a saline water-table and associated with the location of sulfidic sediments.",10.1190/geo2011-0507.1
Sv‐Wave Velocities From P‐P And P‐Sv Data For Transversely Isotropic Solids,"Tessmer and Behle (1988) have shown that for P‐SV reflections from subsurfaces consisting of beds of isotropic solids separated by horizontal interfaces, the stacking velocity found for P‐SV reflection data is approximately the square root of the product of the P‐wave and SV‐wave stacking velocities from that reflection, i.e., VP‐SV≈VPVSV. Even though P‐SV traveltime curves are not hyperbolic, the approximation is surprisingly good for the velocity fields considered by Tessmer and Behle. Given P‐wave and P‐SV stacking velocities, a reasonably accurate SV‐wave stacking velocity could be computed.",10.1190/1.1442594

A Solution For Tm‐Mode Plane Waves Incident On A Two‐Dimensional Inhomogeneity,"Quantitative interpretation of magnetotelluric (MT) surveys depends at present on the availability of an efficient forward modeling algorithm. To date, two major numerical techniques have been used to obtain the scattered fields from buried inhomogeneities in plane‐wave fields: methods solving the governing differential equation which generally uses a finite‐element or finite‐difference approach, and methods which solve an integral‐equation formulation of the problem. For two‐dimensional (2-D) inhomogeneities a solution for incident fields with the electric field parallel to the strike of the inhomogeneity (TE mode solution) was developed by Hohmann (1971) using the integral‐equation approach. For a perfect conductor an integral formulation, for surface scattering currents, for the TM mode (magnetic field parallel to the strike of the inhomogeneity) was developed by Parry (1969). General 2-D solutions in the presence of an arbitrary mode plane wave (mixed TE-TM) were obtained by Ryu (1970), Swift (1971), and Rijo (1977) using either a finite‐element or finite‐difference technique.",10.1190/1.1441989
Use Of Reciprocity Theorem For Computation Of Low‐Frequency Radiation Patterns,"Starting with a simple word statement of the reciprocity which exists between forces and displacements in a general elastic solid, it is shown that low‐frequency radiation of shear and compressional waves from relatively complex sources can be obtained by solving relatively simple problems in static elasticity. Illustrative examples include radiation from radial and tangential pairs of forces acting on the wall of a cylinder, pressure in a finite cylinder, and a pair of radial forces in a hole in a plate. For the last case, measurements in a plexiglas plate compare favorably with computations.",10.1190/1.1438742
Acoustic Vti Modeling Using High-Order Finite Differences,"Two second-order wave equations for acoustic vertical transversely isotropic (VTI) media are transformed to six first-order coupled partial differential equations for a more straighforward numerical implementation of the derivatives. The resulting first-order equations have a more natural form for discretization by any finite-difference, pseudospectral, or finite-element method. I discretized the new equations by high-order finite differences and used synthetic seismograms and snapshots for anisotropic and isotropic cases. The relative merits of placing the source deep and close to a free surface are assessed, illustrating advantages of exciting the source inside or outside of a near-surface, thin, isotropic layer. Results show that traveltimes from deep seismic reflectors can remain virtually unaffected when near-surface isotropic layers are included in acoustic VTI media.",10.1190/1.3157242
Changes In Crack Aspect-Ratio Concentration From Heat Treatment: A Comparison Between Velocity Inversion And Experimental Data,"We report petrophysical changes on a suite of Berea sandstones undergoing heat-cycling treatment. Crack concentrations from experimental data (e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR], mercury injection, and thin sections) are compared with results from a modified Cheng-Toksöz velocity inversion model using a differential effective medium to investigate the physical significance of the inversion. We propose a deterministic methodology to estimate grain properties, pore-crack aspect-ratio spectrum, and consistent pore-crack insertion ordering for the inversion. Our inversion scheme reproduces velocity profiles to within   ±5%  . Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that velocity inversion can resolve the increase in concentrations of small cracks as rock samples are heat-treated. The crack concentration changes calculated from the inversion are consistent with other independent experimental data of porosity, density, thin-section observations, NMR spectra, and mercury injection spectra, lending credence to the use of velocity inversion in microstructural characterization.",10.1190/1.2928848
Effect Of Fluid Viscosity On Elastic Wave Attenuation In Porous Rocks,"For all three waves, the terms proportional to η are responsible for the viscoelastc phenomena (viscous shear relaxation), whereas the terms proportional to η−1 account for the visco‐inertial (poroelastic) mechanism of Biot's type. Furthermore, the characteristic frequencies of visco‐elastic ωV and poroelastic ωB attenuation mechanisms obey the relation ωVωB = AωR2, where ωR is the resonant frequency of the layered system, and A is a dimensionless constant of order 1. This result explains why the visco‐elastic and poroelastic mechanisms are usually treated separately in the context of macroscopic theories that imply ω  ωR. The poroelastic mechanism dominates over the visco‐elastic one when the frequency‐indepenent parameter B = ωB/ωV = 12η2/μsρfhf2  1, and vice versa, where hf is the fluid layer thickness, ρf the fluid density, and μs represents the shear modulus of the solid.",10.1190/1.1451798
P‐Wave Velocity And Permeability Distribution Of Sandstones From A Fractured Tight Gas Reservoir,"Compressional wave velocities were measured on spherical samples in more than 100 directions to get the VP symmetry without prior assumptions. Below 50 MPa confining pressure, all samples show a monoclinic symmetry of the P wave velocity distribution, caused by sedimentary layering, fractures, and crossbedding. At higher confining pressure, sedimentary layering is approximately the only effective fabric element, resulting in a more transverse isotropic VP symmetry. Using the geological‐petrophysical model introduced here, the complex symmetry of the VP distributions can only be explained by the rock fabric elements. Furthermore, water saturation increases the velocities and decreases the anisotropy but does not change VP symmetry. This indicates that at this state, all fabric elements, including the fractures, have an influence on P‐wave velocity distribution.",10.1190/1.1451673
A Fast Reduced-Rank Interpolation Method For Prestack Seismic Volumes That Depend On Four Spatial Dimensions,Rank reduction strategies can be employed to attenuate noise and for prestack seismic data regularization. We present a fast version of Cadzow reduced-rank reconstruction method. Cadzow reconstruction is implemented by embedding 4D spatial data into a level-four block Toeplitz matrix. Rank reduction of this matrix via the Lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm is used to recover missing observations and to attenuate random noise. The computational cost of the Lanczos bidiagonalization is dominated by the cost of multiplying a level-four block Toeplitz matrix by a vector. This is efficiently implemented via the 4D fast Fourier transform. The proposed algorithm significantly decreases the computational cost of rank-reduction methods for multidimensional seismic data denoising and reconstruction. Synthetic and field prestack data examples are used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method.,10.1190/geo2012-0038.1
Gravity Inversion Of Basement Relief Constrained By The Knowledge Of Depth At Isolated Points,"We present an interpretation method for the gravity anomaly of an arbitrary interface separating two homogeneous media. It consists essentially of a downward continuation of the observed anomaly and the division of the continued anomaly by a scale factor involving the density contrast between the media. The knowledge of the interface depth at isolated points is used to estimate the depth d1 of the shallowest point of the interface, the density contrast Δρ between the two media, and the coefficients c1 and c2 of a first‐order polynomial representing a linear trend to be removed from data. The solutions are stabilized by introducing a damping parameter in the computation of the downward‐continued anomaly by the equivalent layer method. Different from other interface mapping methods using gravity data, the proposed method: (1) takes into account the presence of an undesirable linear trend in data; (2) requires just intervals for both Δρ (rather than the knowledge of its true value) and coefficients c1 and c2; and (3) does not require the knowledge of the average interface depth z0. As a result of (3), the proposed method does not call for extensive knowledge of the interface depth to obtain a statistically significant estimate of z0; rather, it is able to use the knowledge of the interface depth at just a few isolated points to estimate d1, Δρ, c1, and c2. Tests using synthetic data confirm that the method produces good and stable estimates as far as the established premises (smooth interface separating two homogeneous media and, at most, the presence of an unremoved linear trend in data) are not violated. If the density contrast is not uniform, the method may still be applied using Litinsky's concept of effective density. The method was applied to gravity data from Recôncavo Basin, Brazil, producing good correlations of estimated lows and terraces in the basement with corresponding known geological features.",10.1190/1.1444088
A New Parameter Set For Anisotropic Multiparameter Full-Waveform Inversion And Application To A North Sea Data Set,First presented at the SEG 84th Annual International Meeting.,10.1190/geo2015-0349.1
Microwave Brightness Spectra Of Layered Media,"Many natural media are layered at the scale of microwaves. Examples include frozen soil over moist soil, ice over water, and snow over soil. The microwave brightness spectra of such media may exhibit interference patterns. Such patterns have been observed for emission from fresh‐water ice but not for emission from snow or from seasonally frozen soil. Three factors which determine whether interference is detectable are the spectral resolution of the radiometer, the uniformity of layer thickness, and the distinctness of interfaces between layers. Analyses of these factors show that: (1) The radiobrightnesses of layered media vary sufficiently slowly with wave‐length that radiometers designed for the radio‐astronomy bands provide adequate spectral resolution; (2) a variability of layer thickness greater than 15 percent of the free‐space wavelength in the area viewed by the radiometer will effectively eliminate an interference pattern; and (3) a diffuse interface, whose thickness is 15 percent of the free‐space wave‐length, is transparent to microwaves so that effects of the interface will not appear in the radiobrightness spectrum.",10.1190/1.1440722
Determining Fractal Dimension From Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Data In Rocks With Internal Magnetic Field Gradients,"Pore size distributions in rocks may be represented by fractal scaling, and fractal descriptions of pore systems may be used for prediction of petrophysical properties such as permeability, tortuosity, diffusivity, and electrical conductivity. Transverse relaxation time (T2) distributions determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements may be used to determine the fractal scaling of the pore system, but the analysis is complicated when internal magnetic field gradients at the pore scale are sufficiently large. Through computations in ideal porous media and laboratory measurements of glass beads and sediment samples, we found that the effect of internal magnetic field gradients was most pronounced in rocks with larger pores and a high magnetic susceptibility contrast between the pore fluid and mineral grains. We quantified this behavior in terms of pore size and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) half-echo spacing through scaling arguments. We additionally found that the effects of internal field gradients may be mitigated in the laboratory by performing T2 measurements with different CPMG half-echo spacings and fitting the apparent fractal dimensions determined by the NMR measurements with a model to determine the true pore system fractal dimension.",10.1190/geo2014-0325.1
Joint Inversion Of Source Location And Focal Mechanism Of Microseismicity,"The seismic focal mechanism (FM) is an effective property to indicate source physics, as well as stress and strain distribution in regional, local, and microscales. We have developed an algorithm to jointly invert for the FM and source locations. For a given velocity structure, all possible combinations of source locations (x, y, and z) and FM (strike, dip, and rake) were used to compute traveltimes and polarities of waveforms. Correcting normal moveout times and polarities and stacking all waveforms, the (x, y, z, strike, dip, and rake) combination that gave the strongest stacking power was identified as the optimal solution. Compared with the traditional source scanning algorithm (SSA) that only scanned source locations, this algorithm was thereby called the joint source scanning algorithm (jSSA). The jSSA method was tested rigorously, and it was applied to a hydraulic fracturing data set. Our work determined several advantages against the SSA method: (1) The jSSA method could identify many shear sources that could not be detected by the SSA method due to polarity variation; (2) the jSSA almost always yielded more events than the SSA method, and the added events could often provide much better characterization of the hydraulic fracturing; (3) the statistics of source mechanisms could provide additional knowledge on the orientation of fractures, as well as the local and regional stress and strain field; and (4) for those events that were detected by both methods, the stacking power of jSSA was always higher than that obtained in SSA.",10.1190/geo2015-0272.1
Data-Driven Adaptive Decomposition Of Multicomponent Seabed Seismic Recordings: Application To Shallow-Water Data From The North Sea,"Exploiting the full potential of multicomponent seabed seismic recordings requires the decomposition of the recorded data into their upgoing and downgoing P- and S-wave constituents. We present a case study from the North Sea, where a novel adaptive wave-equation-based decomposition method is applied to a 2D data set shot inline with a cable-based seabed seismic acquisition system. The data were recorded in relatively shallow   (∼150 m)   water, such that severe interference exists between primary reflections and water-layer multiples. Such conditions represent a challenge for many decomposition methods, because these often require a significant amount of interpretive, user-defined input. Conversely, the adaptive algorithm demonstrated in this study is fully data-driven, requiring as sole input a rough estimate of the water depth. The importance of careful mutual calibration of the sensors is demonstrated by critically assessing the properties of the derived calibration filters and the resulting estimates of the elastic properties of the seabed. To assess the effectiveness of the decomposition procedure, we compare a number of key events identified in the unprocessed data with their equivalents in the decomposed wavefields. The results of this case study show that the noninteractive decomposition method, which was demonstrated on seabed seismic data acquired in deep   (∼370 m)   water, can be applied successfully in shallower conditions without further modification.",10.1190/1.2778766
Mixed‐Delay Wavelet Deconvolution Of The Point‐Source Seismogram,"The problem of extracting a mixed‐delay source wavelet from a point‐source seismogram for an acoustic, horizontally stratified medium (bounded by a free surface above and a half‐space below or between two half‐spaces) can be completely solved without any further assumptions about the source pulse or the model parameters. The solution relies on information contained in the so‐called evanescent part of the point‐source seismogram, which can be extracted via a plane‐wave decomposition, i.e., by a transformation of the point‐source seismogram from the time‐space domain into the frequency‐rayparameter domain.",10.1190/1.1443160
Overthrust Imaging With Tomo‐Datuming: A Case Study,"Through the use of iterative turning‐ray tomography followed by wave‐equation datuming (or tomo‐datuming) and prestack depth migration, we generate accurate prestack images of seismic data in overthrust areas containing both highly variable near‐surface velocities and rough topography. In tomo‐datuming, we downward continue shot records from the topography to a horizontal datum using velocities estimated from tomography. Turning‐ray tomography often provides a more accurate near‐surface velocity model than that from refraction statics. The main advantage of tomo‐datuming over tomo‐statics (tomography plus static corrections) or refraction statics is that instead of applying a vertical time‐shift to the data, tomo‐datuming propagates the recorded wavefield to the new datum. We find that tomo‐datuming better reconstructs diffractions and reflections, subsequently providing better images after migration. In the datuming process, we use a recursive finite‐difference (FD) scheme to extrapolate wavefield without applying the imaging condition, such that lateral velocity variations can be handled properly and approximations in traveltime calculations associated with the raypath distortions near the surface for migration are avoided. We follow the downward continuation step with a conventional Kirchhoff prestack depth migration. This results in better images than those migrated from the topography using the conventional Kirchhoff method with traveltime calculation in the complicated near surface. Since FD datuming is only applied to the shallow part of the section, its cost is much less than the whole volume FD migration. This is attractive because (1) prestack depth migration usually is used iteratively to build a velocity model, so both efficiency and accuracy are important factors to be considered; and (2) tomo‐datuming can improve the signal‐to‐noise (S/N) ratio of prestack gathers, leading to more accurate migration velocity analysis and better images after depth migration. Case studies with synthetic and field data examples show that tomo‐datuming is especially helpful when strong lateral velocity variations are present below the topography.",10.1190/1.1444319
Minimum Weighted Norm Interpolation Of Seismic Records,"We propose a wavefield reconstruction scheme for spatially band‐limited signals. The method entails solving an inverse problem where a wavenumber‐domain regularization term is included. The regularization term constrains the solution to be spatially band‐limited and imposes a prior spectral shape. The numerical algorithm is quite efficient since the method of conjugate gradients in conjunction with fast matrix–vector multiplications, implemented via the fast Fourier transform (FFT), is adopted. The algorithm can be used to perform multidimensional reconstruction in any spatial domain.",10.1190/1.1836829
Seismic Wave Attenuation And Dispersion Resulting From Wave-Induced Flow In Porous Rocks — A Review,"One major cause of elastic wave attenuation in heterogeneous porous media is wave-induced flow of the pore fluid between heterogeneities of various scales. It is believed that for frequencies below   1 kHz  , the most important cause is the wave-induced flow between mesoscopic inhomogeneities, which are large compared with the typical individual pore size but small compared to the wavelength. Various laboratory experiments in some natural porous materials provide evidence for the presence of centimeter-scale mesoscopic heterogeneities. Laboratory and field measurements of seismic attenuation in fluid-saturated rocks provide indications of the role of the wave-induced flow. Signatures of wave-induced flow include the frequency and saturation dependence of P-wave attenuation and its associated velocity dispersion, frequency-dependent shear-wave splitting, and attenuation anisotropy. During the last four decades, numerous models for attenuation and velocity dispersion from wave-induced flow have been developed with varying degrees of rigor and complexity. These models can be categorized roughly into three groups ac-cording to their underlying theoretical framework. The first group of models is based on Biot's theory of poroelasticity. The second group is based on elastodynamic theory where local fluid flow is incorporated through an additional hydrodynamic equation. Another group of models is derived using the theory of viscoelasticity. Though all models predict attenuation and velocity dispersion typical for a relaxation process, there exist differences that can be related to the type of disorder (periodic, random, space dimension) and to the way the local flow is incorporated. The differences manifest themselves in different asymptotic scaling laws for attenuation and in different expressions for characteristic frequencies. In recent years, some theoretical models of wave-induced fluid flow have been validated numerically, using finite-difference, finite-element, and reflectivity algorithms applied to Biot's equations of poroelasticity. Application of theoretical models to real seismic data requires further studies using broadband laboratory and field measurements of attenuation and dispersion for different rocks as well as development of more robust methods for estimating dissipation attributes from field data.",10.1190/1.3463417
Migration Of Ground‐Penetrating Radar Data With A Finite‐Element Method That Considers Attenuation And Dispersion,"We use a numerical model to study the effects of attenuation and dispersion upon the migration of ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) profiles. A finite‐element method (FEM) is developed that incorporates attenuation and is used to generate synthetic GPR profiles with random noise. These profiles are then migrated with and without the attenuation term using our FEM codes. The misfit between the position of interfaces in the model and the position of corresponding interfaces in the migrated profile is greatly decreased when the attenuation term is considered in the migration process. The improvement in resolution results from the use of the group velocity rather than any phase velocity. Consequently, for dispersive media the attenuation term of high‐frequency GPR waves cannot be ignored in migration.",10.1190/1.1707067
Target-Oriented Wavefield Tomography Using Synthesized Born Data,"We present a new strategy for efficient wave-equation migration-velocity analysis in complex geological settings. The proposed strategy has two main steps: simulating a new data set using an initial unfocused image and performing wavefield-based tomography using this data set. We demonstrated that the new data set can be synthesized by using generalized Born wavefield modeling for a specific target region where velocities are inaccurate. We also showed that the new data set can be much smaller than the original one because of the target-oriented modeling strategy, but it contains necessary velocity information for successful velocity analysis. These interesting features make this new data set suitable for target-oriented, fast and interactive velocity model-building. We demonstrate the performance of our method on both a synthetic data set and a field data set acquired from the Gulf of Mexico, where we update the subsalt velocity in a target-oriented fashion and obtain a subsalt image with improved continuities, signal-to-noise ratio and flattened angle-domain common-image gathers.",10.1190/geo2010-0383.1
On The Role Of Multiples In Marchenko Imaging,"Marchenko imaging can produce seismic reflection images in which artifacts related to multiples are suppressed. However, in state-of-the-art implementations, multiples do not contribute to the imaged reflectors. With an ""event-by-event"" deconvolution imaging approach, it is possible to use multiples in Marchenko imaging. We illustrate this for a 1D reflection response in which the primary reflection of a specific interface is missing.",10.1190/geo2016-0323.1
Imaging Conditions For Prestack Reverse-Time Migration,"Numerical implementations of six imaging conditions for prestack reverse-time migration show widely differing ability to provide accurate, angle-dependent estimates of reflection coefficients. Evaluation is in the context of a simple, one-interface acoustic model. Only reflection coefficients estimated by normalization of a crosscorrelation image by source illumination or by receiver-/source-wavefield amplitude ratio have the correct angle dependence, scale factor, and sign and the required (dimensionless) units; thus, these are the preferred imaging-condition algorithms. To obtain accurate image amplitudes, source- and receiver-wavefield extrapolations must be able to accurately reconstruct their respective wavefields at the target reflector.",10.1190/1.2903822
Electromagnetic Fields Of A Small Loop Antenna On The Surface Of A Polarizable Medium,"Studies are made in this paper on the characteristics of the electromagnetic fields produced by a small loop antenna placed on the surface of a medium which exhibits induced‐polarization effects. An approximate expression for the effective impedance of a polarizable medium is used for this purpose. Both the real and imaginary parts of the impedance are appreciably frequency‐dependent. Different expressions suitable for specific ranges of time and specific values of the characteristic parameter of the medium are obtained for the fields when the antenna is excited by a step‐function current source. The step‐function responses show marked differences in characteristics as the parameter of the medium is increased from very small values, typical of membrane polarization, to very large values corresponding to electrode polarization. The rate at which the magnitude of the transients decays with time is highly dependent on this parameter. The rate of decay in the initial small part of the transient curve increases, whereas in the remaining major part the rate decreases with rise in the value of the parameter.",10.1190/1.1439423
An Indirect Seismic Method For Determining The Thickness Of A Low‐Velocity Layer Underlying A High‐Velocity Layer,"We present an indirect method for determining the thickness of a low‐velocity layer (LVL) underlying a high‐velocity layer (HVL) in seismic prospecting. Comparison of the average velocity‐depth function determined from the first arrival refraction data with that obtained from reflection data in the same region, especially below the LVL, makes it possible to recognize the presence of the LVL and to estimate its probable thickness. The applicability of the method has been demonstrated in a field case where the presence of an LVL is indicated by geologic evidence. It has been shown that thickness estimates of an LVL and an HVL can be made reliably in situations where the velocity in the LVL can be accurately estimated from nearby exposures or in a drilled well. For the field case analyzed, a thickness of 0.75 km was estimated for an LVL (probably Mesozoic sediments) underlying a 0.25 km thick HVL (probably basalt). The velocity of propagation in the LVL was taken from seismic data on nearby exposed Mesozoics as 4.0 km/sec, and the velocity of the HVL is 5.4 km/sec, based on the refraction data. In areas where the velocity in the LVL cannot be inferred accurately, an upper limit of this velocity can be obtained which permits estimation of the maximum possible thickness of the LVL. In the field example presented, we show that the velocity in the LVL cannot exceed 4.17 km/sec.",10.1190/1.1441238
Seismic Velocities Of Unconsolidated Sands: Part 1 — Pressure Trends From 0.1 To 20 Mpa ,"Knowledge of the pressure dependences of seismic velocities in unconsolidated sands is necessary for the remote prediction of effective pressures and for the projection of velocities to unsampled locations within shallow sand layers. We have measured the compressional- and shear-wave velocities and bulk, shear, and P-wave moduli at pressures from   0.1 to 20 MPa   in a series of unconsolidated granular samples including dry and water-saturated natural sands and dry synthetic sand and glass-bead samples. The shear-wave velocities in these samples demonstrate an average pressure dependence approximately proportional to the fourth root of the effective pressure   ( VS ∝ p′1∕4 )  , as commonly observed at lower pressures. For the compressional-wave velocities, theexponent in the pressure dependence of individual dry samples is consistently less than the exponent for the shear-wave velocity of the same sample, averaging 0.23 for the dry sands and 0.20 for the glass-bead samples. These pressure dependences are generally consistent over the entire pressure range measured. A comparison of the empirical results to theoretical predictions based on Hertz-Mindlin effective-medium models demonstrates that the theoretical models vastly overpredict the shear moduli of the dry granular frame unless the contacts are assumed to have no tangential stiffness. The models also predict a lower pressure exponent for the moduli and velocities   (V∝ p′1∕6 )   than is generally observed in the data. We attribute this discrepancy in part to the inability of the models to account for decreases in the amount of slip or grain rotation occurring at grain-to-grain contacts with increasing pressure.",10.1190/1.2399459
Five Ways To Avoid Storing Source Wavefield Snapshots In 2D Elastic Prestack Reverse Time Migration,"Five alternative algorithms were evaluated to circumvent the excessive storage requirement imposed by saving source wavefield snapshots used for the crosscorrelation image condition in 2D prestack elastic reverse time migration. We compared the algorithms on the basis of their ability, either to accurately reconstruct (not save) the source wavefield or to use an alternate image condition so that neither saving nor reconstruction of full wavefields was involved. The comparisons were facilitated by using the same (velocity-stress) extrapolator in all the algorithms, and running them all on the same hardware. We assumed that there was enough memory in a node to do an extrapolation, and that all input data were stored on disk rather than residing in random-access memory. This should provide a fair and balanced comparison. Reconstruction of the source wavefield from boundary and/or initial values reduced the required storage to a very small fraction of that needed to store source wavefield snapshots for conventional crosscorrelation, at the cost of adding an additional source extrapolation. Reverse time checkpointing avoided recursive forward recomputation. Two nonreconstructive imaging conditions do not require full snapshot storage or an additional extrapolation. Time-binning the imaging criteria removed the need for image time searching or sorting. Numerical examples using elastic data from the Marmousi2 model showed that the quality of the elastic prestack PP and PS images produced by the cost-optimized alternative algorithms were (virtually) identical to the higher cost images produced by traditional crosscorrelation.",10.1190/geo2014-0014.1
The Reconstruction Of The Magnetotelluric Impedance Tensor: An Adaptive Parametric Time‐Domain Approach,"Magnetotelluric (MT) data processing for the estimation of the impedance tensor is usually carried out in the frequency domain using nonparametric methods of spectral analysis. In this paper, the impedance tensor is reconstructed using an adaptive parametric time‐domain approach, whereby the observed MT data are used directly in the estimation process without the need for a frequency‐domain transformation. In such a reconstruction, the impedance tensor is represented by a rational‐form or matrix‐fraction model. The parameters for this model are determined using a recursive instrumental variables (RIV) adaptation algorithm, allowing on‐line real‐time application. This adaptation algorithm is capable of providing consistent estimates for the impedance tensor from only the observed (i.e., noisy) MT field data and auxiliary information in the form of measurements of the contemporaneous components of the magnetic field at some remote site. Hence, the RIV algorithm provides a time‐domain implementation of the remote‐reference MT method, which has been applied with good success for unbiased impedance tensor determination in the frequency domain for moderate‐to‐high‐level noise conditions.",10.1190/1.1442544
A Proposed Standard Format For Nine‐Track Digital Tape,"Digital seismic tapes have, to the present time, been prepared in a great variety of formats. With the rapid growth of digital recording and the strong likelihood that tapes will be exchanged among the various oil companies and contractors, an urgent need for standardization has become apparent.",10.1190/1.1439813
3D Controlled-Source Electromagnetic Edge-Based Finite Element Modeling Of Conductive And Permeable Heterogeneities,"A new 3D controlled-source electromagnetic finite element (FE) modeling algorithm is presented which is capable of handling local inhomogeneities in the magnetic permeability and electrical conductivity distribution of buried geologic and anthropogenic structures. An ungauged, coupled-potential formulation of the governing electromagnetic vector diffusion and scalar continuity equations is used. The formulation introduces magnetic reluctivity, the inverse of magnetic permeability, to facilitate a separation of secondary and primary potentials. The governing equations are solved using a tetrahedral edge-based FE method. The postprocessing steps to obtain electromagnetic fields are outlined. The code is validated for non-magnetic and permeable conductive structures by comparisons against analytic and previously published numerical solutions. Some limitations of the implementation are explored and directions are proposed for its further development.",10.1190/1.3571045
Magnetic Prospecting For Iron Ores In Jamaica,"Two ground magnetometer surveys over iron ore deposits in Jamaica are described and the results of the observations interpreted. An improvised but economical technique is used to measure the main magnetic properties of ore samples obtained from surface exposures, and a suitable statistical analysis is applied to determine the significance of these observations. The interpretation of the magnetic profiles, carried out on the basis of these observations, is complicated by the non‐uniformity of the natural remanent magnetization of the ores and the roughness of Jamaican topography. The ambiguities due to the latter factor are diminished by taking into account in the computations the changes in the elevation of the ground surface. The results of the interpretation are on the whole successful and give the approximate sizes and positions of the main ore bodies. A conclusion is reached that, in the case of small‐scale near‐surface deposits whose approximate position is already known, ground magnetometer surveys can be superior to those made from the air because of their smaller cost and greater power of resolution in rough terrain.",10.1190/1.1438163
Resolution Of Slowness And Reflectors In Crosswell Tomography With Transmission And Reflection Traveltimes,"We sometimes encounter situations in seismic imaging in which knowing the position of key reflectors between wells would be very useful. In many crosswell data sets, both transmission and reflection traveltimes for selected reflectors can be picked. We investigated the possibility that transmission-plus-reflection crosswell traveltime tomography can determine the position of these reflectors with a high level of accuracy, thereby providing an independent way of verifying (and perhaps improving) the position of these reflectors obtained from crosswell reflection imaging. We studied the effect of combining reflection traveltimes for selected reflectors with transmission traveltimes on the resolution of the interwell slowness field and depth determination of selected reflectors. We found that theoretically, the position of reflectors is determined uniquely from transmission and reflection traveltimes in a linearized continuum formulation ofcrosswell tomography. We also computed diagonal elements of the resolu-tion matrix for two crosswell geometries based on field experiments conducted in a west Texas oil field to see what effect noise has on the accuracy of our determination of reflector depths. These computational results indicate that reflector positions are indeed very well determined for these geometries, with expected errors of   ∼0.5%   of the well spacing when noise in traveltimes is   ∼2%  . Because reflector-position parameters are so well determined, including reflection traveltimes does not degrade the resolution of the slowness field as a result of introducing additional reflector-depth parameters. Actually, the resolution of the slowness field, particularly near reflectors, improves by including reflection traveltimes, in spite of the fact that we must solve for these additional depth parameters. The improvement in slowness resolution should provide velocity models that can yield more accurate reflection images.",10.1190/1.2969777
An Exact Solution Of The Conversion Point For The Converted Waves From A Dipping Reflector With Homogeneous (Isotropic) Overburden,"For converted waves, stacking traces with a common reflection point, forming gathers, and performing dip moveout (DMO) all require accurately calculating the location of conversion points. Because of the asymmetrical paths of converted waves, even for horizontally layered media, the calculation of a conversion point for converted waves is complicated. Previous authors have obtained analytic solutions for the conversion point for converted waves in a horizontally layered media. We extend those results to the more general case of converted waves from a dipping reflector with a homogeneous, isotropic overburden. By using Snell's law, we derive a quartic equation and solve it uniquely for the conversion point. The resultant analytic expression is a function of offset, compressional-, and shear-wave velocities; normal reflector depth; and dip angle at the conversion point. This solution can be readily used to generate accurate synthetic seismic responses for converted waves based on ray theory. It also can be extended to operators for stacking converted waves and applying DMO correction.",10.1190/1.2149900
Fields Of A Vertical Magnetic Dipole Over A Vertically Inhomogeneous Earth,"The electromagnetic field components are expressed in terms of Sommerfeld‐type improper integrals, the integrands of which depend upon the solution of a nonlinear differential equation. Combining a collection of Runge‐Kutta numerical integration methods with the extrapolation to the limit, a desired accuracy in the final result is obtained by varying the step‐size along the structure according to the local error. Actual calculations were performed for: (1) A homogeneous half‐space having on top several layers with linearly varying conductivity sandwiching a very conductive or a very resistive layer. (2) A stack of homogeneous layers over a resistive or a conductive half‐space. (3) A transition layer in a stack of homogeneous layers. The ratios of the field components to corresponding components for a half‐space as functions of ""numerical distance"" are strongly correlated to the variation of resistivity with depth. (The main portions of the graphs of the absolute values and phases for all the ratios show a striking similarity for a given model.) This characteristic curve, called loosely ""model line"" starts with a maximum for a resistive half‐space and a minimum for a conductive one. Further maxima and minima reflect the conductivity of the various layers. A similar behavior occurs when transition layers are present, although the model lines show lower peaks and are smoother.",10.1190/1.1440876
The Boundary Element Method For 3‐D Dc Resistivity Modeling In Layered Earth,Model calculations demonstrate that the results obtained by this method compare well with the analytical solution of a sphere in a uniform half‐space and the asymptotic behavior for the solution of a buried body beneath a surficial layer as the layer resistivity approaches that of the half‐space. A comparison of responses over elongate 3‐D bodies with responses over 2‐D bodies of identical cross‐section also shows satisfactory agreement.,10.1190/1.1468622
Ergodicity Of Stationary White Gaussian Processes,"Stationary time series is an important concept in seismic signal processing. According to Robinson (1967), the method of predictive deconvolution is the minimum‐delay interpretation of the decomposition theorem of Wold (1938) for stationary time series. Stationary noise models have found use in geophysics as well (Robinson and Treitel, 1980).",10.1190/1.1444502
"Reflection And Refraction Seismic Studies In The Great Salt Lake Desert, Utah","Seismic refraction and CDP reflection profiles were acquired across mud flats of the Great Salt Lake Desert, Utah, during the summer of 1983. a combination of weight drops, horizontal hammers, buried explosives, and explosives detonated in air (Poulter method) was used. A 6.4 km refraction and single‐fold reflection profile indicates the presence of a shallow depression (Donner Reed basin) eastb of Donner Reed pass in the Silver Island Mountains. A basin floor ramp of Paleozoic rocks dipping approximately 30 degrees east into the Crater Island graben is interpreted beneath a 4.6 km 12-fold CDP reflection profile obtained by the Poulter method. This ramp extends beneath at least 0.8 km of condolidated Neogene sediments and 0.8 km of younger (largely unconsolidated) sediments. Weight‐drop and horizontal‐hammer profiles for the critical refraction along the Silurian Laketown dolomite yield P-wave and S-wave velocity estimates of 5270 ± 100 and 2950±250m/s, respectively. The mud flats, with their laterally uniform finegrained sediments and shallow water table, provided excellent coupling of seismic energy. Air shots of 4.1 to 5.4 kg explosives without a source array gave good penetration to a depth of about 1.6 km. Partial migration before stack facilitated estimation of moveout velocities in the case of layers onlapping against a basin floor ramp, even though the maximum dips were only about 30 degrees. Gravity modeling and seismic ray tracing through intervals of constant velocity bounded by polynomial interfaces aided synergetic interpretation of the reflection, refraction, and gravity data.",10.1190/1.1442475
Test Of A Quantitative Mountain Building Theory By Appalachian Structural Dimensions,"A mathematical paper by Ross Gunn (Journal of the Franklin Institute, volume 224, pages 19–53, 1937) gives a mountain building theory which makes possible the calculation of certain structural dimensions in terms of thickness and strength of the geologic elements involved. The present paper applies various formulae from Gunn's paper to the calculation of width and amplitude of folds, to basin widths and depths, and to mountain heights of the Appalachian Mountain system. The numerical values resulting are in surprisingly good agreement with previously published values measured or estimated from the known geology of the area. A brief discussion is also given of the theoretical interpretation, by Gunn's theory, of the large isostatic gravity anomaly here as due to possible crustal stress.",10.1190/1.1444992
A Periodically Varying Code For Improving Deblending Of Simultaneous Sources In Marine Acquisition,"We have designed a periodically varying code that can avoid the problem of the local coherency and make the interference distribute uniformly in a given range; hence, it was better at suppressing incoherent interference (blending noise) and preserving coherent useful signals compared with a random dithering code. We have also devised a new form of the iterative method to remove interference generated from the simultaneous source acquisition. In each iteration, we have estimated the interference using the blending operator following the proposed formula and then subtracted the interference from the pseudodeblended data. To further eliminate the incoherent interference and constrain the inversion, the data were then transformed to an auxiliary sparse domain for applying a thresholding operator. During the iterations, the threshold was decreased from the largest value to zero following an exponential function. The exponentially decreasing threshold aimed to gradually pass the deblended data to a more acceptable model subspace. Two numerically blended synthetic data sets and one numerically blended practical field data set from an ocean bottom cable were used to demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method and the better performance of the periodically varying code over the traditional random dithering code.",10.1190/geo2015-0447.1
Apparent Azimuthal Shear Anisotropy From Normal‐Moveout Differentials,"A simple normal‐moveout (NMO) correction can move common‐depth‐point (CDP) reflection times up or down a few milliseconds when the stacking velocity is varied a small fraction. Different stacking velocities on two orthogonal shear components are often required, such as in the cases of azimuthal anisotropic media (Thomsen, 1986) or transversely isotropic media (Levin, 1979). The difference between these two cases is that CDP reflection times are different on S1 and S2 in the case of azimuthal anisotropy, while CDP reflection times are equal for transverse isotropic media. The similarity is that both cases require different stacking velocities on the S1 and S2 components.",10.1190/1.1442816
Convergence Of Traveltime Power Series For A Layered Vti Medium,"For a multiply reflected SH-wave or a multiply reflected and converted qP/qSV-wave in a layered VTI medium, traveltime and offset can be expressed by power series in horizontal slowness. As for a stack of isotropic layers, these can be used to express traveltime as a series of even powers of offset. The existence and behavior of this power series depend on the derivative of offset with respect to horizontal slowness, formally expressed as traveltime multiplied by NMO-velocity squared. When the NMO-velocity squared is different from zero, the power series always exists for sufficiently small offset. The NMO-velocity squared is always positive for SH-waves and for qP-waves in media with normal polarization, for which there are no triplications in traveltime as function of offset. For qSV-wave propagation insome layers, the NMO-velocity squared may be positive, zero, or negative. When it is positive, the power series exists, but there may be an off-axis triplication in traveltime. When the NMO-squared velocity is zero, the power series does not exist, and there is an incipient triplication on the vertical axis. When the NMO-velocity squared is negative, there is a triplication in traveltime on the vertical axis. The power series exists and represents the first-arrival traveltime branch. Numerical examples show that when the value of the NMO-velocity squared is small, the power series for a qSV-wave can be used only for very small values of offset. The series of traveltime squared in powers of offset al-ways exists when the series for traveltime exists; therefore, it must have the same or larger region of convergence.",10.1190/1.2434774
Eötvös Corrections For A Moving Gravity Meter,"When making gravity measurements with a moving meter, the Eötvös correction is often the limiting factor in the precision of the entire system. Nomograms are presented showing the error to be expected in the Eötvös correction for errors of various sizes in the determination of ground speed, heading, and latitude of the vehicle.",10.1190/1.1439057
"Deepwater Vibrator Operations—Beaufort Sea, Alaska, 1979, Winter Season","During the four‐month period January—April, 1979, a relatively extensive seismic survey was undertaken by Sohio Petroleum Co. in the offshore Beaufort Sea area. This discussion is simply a case history of the project from the planning stage through its conclusion. Example data and production statistics are given.",10.1190/1.1441187
The Effect Of Charge Size On Reflection Records,Examples are presented showing the effect of charge size on: the ratio of the amplitude of reflected motion to that of surface waves; the ratio of the amplitude of reflected motion to that of random interference; the frequency spectrum of reflected motion. The similarity between these observations and the effects of changing depth of shooting are discussed. It is concluded that the use of a larger or a smaller charge in a particular circumstance may be the means of effecting a useful improvement in a record.,10.1190/1.1445071
3-D Inversions Of Magnetic Gradiometer Data In Archeological Prospecting: Possibilities And Limitations,"A vertical‐gradient magnetic system based on optically pumped Cesium sensors has been used to map subtle magnetic anomalies across infilled pit houses and ditches at a medieval archeological site in northern Switzerland. For estimating the locations and dimensions of these features from the recorded data, we have designed and implemented an appropriate inversion scheme. Tests of this scheme on realistic synthetic data sets suggested that suitable minimum magnetic susceptibility contrasts and smoothing parameters for the inversion may be directly extracted from the data. Inversions with minimum magnetic susceptibility contrasts generated causative bodies with maximum plausible sizes. By using higher magnetic susceptibility contrasts, a complete suite of models that matched the data equally well was produced. To constrain better the magnetic susceptibility constrast within a selected area of the archeological site, shallow samples of topsoil and sediment were analyzed in the laboratory. An inversion based on the measured magnetic susceptibility contrast yielded reliable estimates of the locations, 3-D geometries, and sizes of two small pit houses. The depth extent of one pit house was subsequently verified by shallow drilling. We concluded that inversions of vertical‐gradient magnetic data constrained by magnetic susceptibility or shallow borehole information are rapid and inexpensive means of providing key knowledge on the depth distribution of inductively magnetized bodies.",10.1190/1.1444782
Obtaining Three‐Dimensional Velocity Information Directly From Reflection Seismic Data: An Inverse Scattering Formalism,"We present a formalism for obtaining the subsurface velocity configuration directly from reflection seismic data. Our approach is to apply the results obtained for inverse problems in quantum scattering theory to the reflection seismic problem. In particular, we extend the results of Moses (1956) for inverse quantum scattering and Razavy (1975) for the one‐dimensional (1-D) identification of the acoustic wave equation to the problem of identifying the velocity in the three‐dimensional (3-D) acoustic wave equation from boundary value measurements. No a priori knowledge of the subsurface velocity is assumed and all refraction, diffraction, and multiple reflection phenomena are taken into account. In addition, we explain how the idea of slant stack in processing seismic data is an important part of the proposed 3-D inverse scattering formalism.",10.1190/1.1441252
Defining Archaeological Features With Electromagnetic Surveys At The Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site,"Electromagnetic (EM) surveys have been used at the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in southwestern Illinois to locate and define a number of buried archaeological features. Two instruments, Geonics EM31-D and EM38 conductivity meters, were employed to locate portions of a wooden stockade known as the Central Palisade; delineate a number of leveled earthen mounds; and explore a broad, flat area in the central portion of the site known as the Grand Plaza. EM surveys, together with limited excavation, provide a cost effective and nondestructive means of exploring a site as large and complex as Cahokia. Archaeological excavations confirmed that EM surveys were able to locate the Central Palisade, and more importantly, that they provided information on anthropogenically modified terrain within the Grand Plaza. The EM survey documented buried ridge and swale topography and borrow pits within this area. This evidence of landscape modification challenges previous conceptions about the extent of earthmoving at this important Mississippian center and suggests a promising area of application for EM surveys in archaeology.",10.1190/1.1443150
Interpretation Of Seismic Refraction Data And The Solution Of The Hidden Layer Problem,"A new statistical method is described for the interpretation of seismic refraction data. This method is then applied to the interpretation of a seismic refraction profile 15,220 m long shot by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India along the Hoshiarpur‐Tanda road in Punjab State. The 14th iteration least squares straight line fit made to the traveltimes of first refracted arrivals gives for the Hoshiarpur area five layers 144, 322, 726, 769, and 1711 m thick with velocities of 1667, 1906, 2209, 2778, and 3505 m/sec respectively above the basement at a depth of 3672±11 m. The basement velocity is found to be 6514 m/sec. Analysis of later refracted arrivals indicates the existence of a hidden layer with a velocity 4280 m/sec in the Hoshiarpur area. Due to the presence of the hidden layer, the fifth layer with a thickness of 1711 m computed from first arrival analysis is split into two layers with thicknesses of 1160±10 and 752±18 m; the 752‐m‐thick layer is the hidden layer. As a result of the hidden layer, the computed basement depth increases to 3873±21 m. The importance of later refracted arrivals for the solution of hidden layer problems in refraction seismology is duly stressed. An extension of Green's method (1962) for determining the possible range of a hidden layer thickness beneath a multiple layer overburden is given and applied to the field problem discussed in this paper.",10.1190/1.1440119
Theoretical And Experimental Examinations Of The Capacitively Coupled Resistivity (Line Antenna) Method,"The capacitively coupled (CC) resistivity method is an emerging geophysical technique for near-surface investigations. However, there are two major problems associated with using the CC resistivity (line antenna) system in ground investigations. These two problems are (1) the geometrical factor and (2) measurement biases. We first derive the geometric factor for the line-antenna array in a dipole-dipole configuration. The new expression of the geometric factor considers the separation between the two current (and the two potential) line antennas, thereby improving the accuracy of the measured apparent resistivity. Second, from the electroquasistatic point of view, a quadruline model that can describe the characteristics of the CC resistivity (line antenna) system is derived based on the previously published quadrupole model. The validity of the quadruline model is verified experimentally. Based on the quadruline model, it is found that the dielectric properties of the line-to-ground capacitor and the ground permittivity produce measurement bias at low and high current frequencies, respectively. If the operating current frequency is around the kHz range and the ground resistivity is relatively high, such as in permafrost areas, the ground permittivity can also create measurement bias to cause the actual value to be underestimated. The experimental results and the predictions by the quadruline model suggest that the measurement bias induced by the gap between the line antenna and the ground surface becomes significant and cannot be ignored as the gap height is large and the associated ground resistivity is low. In general, the CC resistivity (line antenna) measurements are not biased by the gap effect when the gap height is less than 0.01 m, which can easily be achieved for tests on flat ground.",10.1190/geo2012-0376.1
Examination Of Avo Responses In The Eastern Deepwater Gulf Of Mexico,"Exploration programs in deepwater Tertiary basins (e.g., the Gulf of Mexico) typically rely on bright‐spot and amplitude variation with offset (AVO) technology to help identify oil‐ and gas‐charged sands. The reliance on these attributes, along with the high cost of exploration programs in deepwater environments, has driven the need to examine the limitations of these technologies and to build robust models for the conditions under which AVO is useful as a fluid and/or lithology indicator. We build subregional AVO background trends for both brine‐ and gas‐saturated sands from several wells from the eastern deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These trends are built from the depth dependencies of velocities and densities for both shale and sands (brine saturated). Simple models of AVO gradient and intercept are constructed as a function of depth below the mud line. Sand and shale properties show little velocity contrast, justifying the interpretation of these data in the context of linearized AVO models. In addition to the in‐situ brine response, the response to gas is also calculated. These trend models indicate that the AVO response is suppressed (although still positive) below a depth of approximately 10 000 ft below the mud line. Even optimistic porosity modeling (sand porosity 30°) does not substantially change this conclusion. An important corollary is that the absence of a strong AVO anomaly at these deeper depths cannot be used with confidence when ruling out hydrocarbon presence. This observation also highlights the need to crossplot attributes to best predict hydrocarbon presence. Velocity data collected as part of this study are also used to generate a local shear velocity estimator for sands and shale. These shear estimators are similar in form to other published estimators, but minor differences in coefficients may become important in AVO modeling.",10.1190/1.1487130
An Interpretive Analysis Of Magnetotelluric Data,"A simple analysis to determine the dimensionality of magnetotelluric resistivity variations, to separate the near‐surface resistivity variation from the variations at depth, and to find the relative resistivity variations with depth is described. Parameters derived from the magnetotelluric impedance tensor are mapped in pseudosection and planar view for two‐dimensional (2-D) model data and for survey data from Montana. These data illustrate procedures that can qualitatively map complex resistivity structures in the lateral distance‐frequency domain or, equivalently, the lateral distance‐scaled vertical distance domain. Phase‐dependent parameters have better vertical resolution than parameters related to scalar apparent resistivity, but the latter allow estimates of the resistivities encountered. Phase parameters for the Montana data provide a semiquantitatively accurate cross‐section of a geologically known anticlinal structure. This suggests a means of subsurface structural mapping with magnetotelluric data. The use of these parameters with sufficiently dense and accurate data provides a first‐order indication of structure for subsequent quantitative modeling.",10.1190/1.1441580
Pore-Scale Modeling Of Electrical Resistivity And Permeability In Fib-Sem Images Of Organic Mudrock,"We have developed a new pore-scale method to quantify petrophysical properties of hydrocarbon (HC)-bearing shale. Recent studies indicate that slip flow, Knudsen diffusion, Langmuir desorption, and diffusion in kerogen contribute to the unconventional production properties of shale-gas formations. Conventional petrophysical interpretation methods do not account for the aforementioned phenomena and are often inconclusive when estimating petrophysical properties in shale formations. We constructed a pore-scale representation of the lower Eagle Ford Shale based on focused-ion-beam–scanning-electron-microscope (FIB-SEM) images. Permeability is calculated via previously developed finite-difference methods for the cases with and without slip flow and Knudsen diffusion. The method also calculates streamlines to describe sample pore connectivity. Weighted throat-size distributions are defined based on streamlines to represent the most resistive paths for fluid flow in the FIB-SEM image. Subsequently, permeability is estimated from the dominant throat size in the weighted throat-size distribution. We used a new fluid percolation model for HC-bearing shale that expands HC from kerogen surfaces and water from grain and clay surfaces into the pore space to vary fluid saturation. Isolated pores are randomly distributed within kerogen to increase kerogen maturity in the model. Electrical resistivity is calculated with a finite-difference solution of Kirchhoff's voltage law applied at the pore scale. A parallel conductor model was used based on Archie's equation for water conductivity in pores and a parallel conductive path for the Stern-diffuse layer. Calculations were compared with Waxman-Smits' and Archie's predictions of macroscopic electric conductivity. Using practical modeling parameters, the parallel conductor model yields the most accurate prediction of pore-scale sample conductivity for various cases of water saturation and conductivity.",10.1190/geo2014-0141.1
Mutual Electromagnetic Coupling Of Loops Over A Homogeneous Ground—An Additional Note,Further computations are presented for the mutual impedance between small wire loops over a semi‐infinite conductor.

Appraisal Of Waveform Repeatability For Crosshole And Hole-To-Tunnel Seismic Monitoring Of Radioactive Waste Repositories,"Countries worldwide are seeking solutions for the permanent removal of high-level radioactive waste from the environment. Surrounding the waste with multiple engineered barriers and emplacement in deep geological repositories is widely accepted as a safe means of isolating it from the biosphere for the necessary    105 – 106 years  . As a precautionary measure, society demands that repositories be monitored for   100–300 years   after they are backfilled and sealed. Effective monitoring that does not compromise the engineered and natural barriers is challenging. To address this issue, we investigate the viability of crosshole and hole-to-tunnel seismic methods for remotely monitoring high level radioactive waste repositories. Measurements are made at two underground rock laboratories in Switzerland, one within granitic rock and one within clay-rich sediments. Numerical simulations demonstrate that temporal changes of the monitored features (i.e., bentonite plug, excavation damage zone, sand-filled microtunnel) should produce significant changes in the seismicwaveforms. Nevertheless, inversion for medium-property changes requires that true seismic waveform changes are not overwhelmed by recording variations. We find that a P-wave sparker source is highly repeatable up to frequencies of   3–4 kHz   for propagation distances out to tens of meters involved in repository-scale monitoring. Hydrophone repeatability is limited by incoherent high frequency noise and variable hydrophone-borehole coupling conditions, but firmly grouted geophones within the tunnels yield consistent recordings. Three kinds of coherent noise contaminate the data: (1) mechanically induced electrical effects in the hydrophone chains; (2) high currents in the sparker cable, which cause it to oscillate radially as a line source; and (3) tube waves. Our investigations outline a quantitative methodology to assess data-quality requirements for successful monitoring. We suggest that full waveform seismic tomography can be used to monitor radioactive waste emplacement tunnels, provided that careful attention is paid to instrument fidelity and noise suppression.",10.1190/1.3479552
"Four Shallow‐Depth, Shear‐Wave Feasibility Studies","Studies using a hammer‐impact source were made to evaluate the feasibility of using shallow‐depth, seismic shear‐wave methods to (1) detect earth fissures, (2) map an aguiclude, (3) locate a bedrock channel, and (4) study the fault and fracture system within a highly fractured welded tuff. For detecting earth fissures, a V/V (vertical‐impact, vertical‐geophone—recording both P-waves and vertically polarized shear waves, SV), 6-m common‐offset procedure was used; for mapping the aquiclude, an R/R (radial‐impact, radial‐geophone—recording predominantly SV), unbalanced‐split‐spread procedure; and for the bedrock channel search, a wide‐angle, T/T (transverse‐impact, transverse‐geophone—recording horizontally polarized shear waves, SH) reflection procedure. The principal result of these investigations is that it is technically feasible through use of shear‐wave methods to obtain reasonable solutions to the first three problems. For the tuff study, wave tests showed phase velocity differences between R/R and T/T recordings indicating shear‐wave splitting, and revealed a fault between blocks of seemingly similar lithology.",10.1190/1.1442999
Two‐Fold Resistivity Mapping Of Lateral Inhomogeneities,"In mining exploration and engineering studies, resistivity mapping is often used to locate and delineate laterally inhomogeneous structures. When surveying is done with a fixed current source, as in the dipole mapping method (Bibby and Risk, 1973; Keller et al., 1975) the simplicity in its application is often offset by the difficulty of contouring the existing anomalies and in estimating their magnitudes. More recently, Doicin (1976) proposed a bidirectional variation of the dipole mapping method, the quadripole‐quadripole method, which has been found to yield anomaly contours notably less affected by distortion than those obtained with the dipole mapping method. Furthermore, it has been shown that the quadripole apparent resistivity can, to a first approximation, be regarded as independent of the orientation of the source.",10.1190/1.1440810
S-Zero Stack: A Converted Wave Processing To Extract Subsurface Density Information,"Analyzing the Aki-Richards equation for converted waves, I found that it is possible to decouple the effect of density contrast from that of shear velocity contrast. The two terms were mixed when the P-wave incident angle was less than 30°, but they started to separate at a middle angle range (approximately 40°). The term related to S-wave velocity contrast reached zero at an incident angle around 60°. However, the other term, which was related to the density contrast, did not reverse polarity until 90°. Furthermore, this density term reached almost the maximum (magnitude) around 60°. Based on those characteristics, I designed a new method called ""S-Zero Stack"" to capture the density contrast reliably at the subsurface interface without going to inversion. S-Zero Stack captured subsurface density anomalies using a special stacking method. It is simple but robust, even when there is noise in the common-conversion-point gathers. Combined with the traditional P-wave amplitude-variation-with-offset technique, S-Zero Stack of PS-waves may help discriminate commercial gas from fizz in gas sand and could be a useful tool in shale gas exploration to locate lower-density anomalies (sweet spots).",10.1190/geo2013-0029.1
Low-Frequency Fluid Waves In Fractures And Pipes,"Low-frequency analytical solutions have been obtained for phase velocities of symmetrical fluid waves within both an infinite fracture and a pipe filled with a viscous fluid. Three different fluid wave regimes can exist in such objects, depending on the various combinations of parameters, such as fluid density, fluid viscosity, walls shear modulus, channel thickness, and frequency. Equations for velocities of all these regimes have explicit forms and are verified by comparisons with the exact solutions. The dominant role of fractures in rock permeability at field scales and the strong amplitude and frequency effects of Stoneley guided waves suggest the importance of including these wave effects into poroelastic theories.",10.1190/1.3484155
Vertical Seismic Profile Reflectivity: Ups Over Downs,"The idea of designing a deconvolution operator for the vertical seismic profile (VSP) based on its downgoing waves is well known (Anstey, 1976; Gaiser et al., 1984; Hubbard, 1979; Lee and Balch, 1983; Kennett et al., 1980). Many variations of the scheme exist. Anstey (1976) recommends the average of the downgoing wave from all levels as the basis for designing an inverse operator. Lee and Balch (1983) use the downgoing wave from a single level to deconvolve all the VSP traces. Gaiser et al. (1984) and Hubbard (1979) recommend doing the deconvolution independently at each depth level. As observed by Hubbard, there are similar disparities in the literature about whether all or only part of the downgoing wave train should be used in the design of an inverse operator. Although all of the above approaches are identical if multiples are generated in a limited zone near the sea bottom, they differ for more complex media. We recommend, and in this note we explore the theoretical properties of, the level‐by‐level deconvolution based on the entire downgoing wave train. The expressions we develop apply to the general case of the vertical VSP response to any number of horizontal layers with any degree of complexity in the process that generates multiples.",10.1190/1.1442379
"Correcting Amplitude, Time, And Phase Mis‐Ties In Seismic Data","Seismic lines from different vintages frequently mis‐tie where they intersect. The mis‐ties may stem from different amplitudes, a shift in time, or different wavelet character. We can correct these mis‐ties to a great extent by applying a scale factor, a static time shift, and a phase rotation to one of the lines. We describe algorithms to compute the amplitude, time, and phase differences at each intersection among a series of 2-D seismic lines. We can then use an iterative least‐squares technique to derive optimal mis‐tie corrections for each line. We include a necessary modification of the least‐squares technique for the nonlinear phase data. The various algorithms are stable, fast, and accurate. We have used them in conjunction with an interactive workstation seismic interpretation program for five years. The scalar mis‐tie corrections greatly enhance the consistency of the seismic data. We show the results of the mis‐tie package applied to a 20‐line survey consisting of five vintages of seismic data. The resulting mis‐tie corrections significantly improve the fit between the 20 lines.",10.1190/1.1443654
Acquisition Footprints And Seafloor Coupling In Multicomponent Obc Seismic Data,"In four-component (4-C) towed ocean-bottom-cable (OBC) data sets, acquisition footprints are often observed. Sometimes these exhibit a spatial period equal to the length of the receiver cable. I have analyzed a 2D 4-C OBC data set, looking at common-offset gathers (COG), spectral analyses, and hodogram analyses of the direct P-wave first breaks. The acquisition footprint is seen to be directly related to the following effects observed on a few of the multicomponent receivers, namely, those nearest to the towing vessel: significant delays on the inline component though not on the downgoing direct-P first breaks; depletion of higher frequencies (narrower bandwidth) on the inline component; and oscillatory motion closer to the vertical on the direct-P first breaks equivalent to decreased amplitude on the in-line component. This is interpreted to be a result of the towing procedure wherein the leading end of the cable, with the first few receiver modules, is raised from the seafloor and laid down again, relatively lightly, on top of seafloor material that might be poorly consolidated, while the trailing receivers are pulled through and down into this material. For these leading receiver modules, this results in poor inline horizontal coupling (i.e., slipping) and delayed P-S onsets due to their vertically higher positions (relative to the trailing receivers) and quite high near-seafloor    VP ∕ VS    ratios. To rectify this problem in future acquisition, a longer lead-in cable should prevent lifting of the leading receivers and allow all of them to couple with the seafloor in the same way. For data already acquired with an acquisition footprint on the inline component, a two-step process involving surface-consistent deconvolution or trace equalization and static correction is proposed.",10.1190/1.3294571
Bathymetric Effects And Corrections In Marine Csem Data,"The effect of seafloor topographic variations on controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) responses is investigated using a finite-difference modeling approach for both petroleum and gas-hydrate exploration scenarios. In a deepwater reservoir model, distortions in the inline electric field responses are mainly due to galvanic effects, particularly at long transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) offsets, and are characterized by persistent short-wavelength anomalies at all Tx-Rx offsets in the amplitude profiles. In a shallow-water reservoir model, the contribution of inductive effects to bathymetric distortions is large at short Tx-Rx offsets compared to the deepwater case, whereas at long offsets, the distortion pattern is mainly determined by the source-receiver geometry relative to the sea surface because of the airwave effect rather than by the resistivity variations associated with the seafloor topography. A simple correction technique, which is an extension of the topographic correction procedure for magnetotelluric data, is effective in removing the bathymetric distortions for the deep marine case, but cannot be used for the shallow-water case because of the airwave effect. For a gas-hydrate exploration model, it is shown that the bathymetric response can be large enough to mask the target response, because higher frequencies and shorter offsets need to be used to detect the shallow targets. However, the modeling study suggests that the shallow target response can be separated from the bathymetric distortions using the correction method.",10.1190/1.3552705
The Possibilities Of Least-Squares Migration Of Internally Scattered Seismic Energy,"Approximate images of the earth's subsurface structures are usually obtained by migrating surface seismic data. Least-squares migration, under the single-scattering assumption, is used as an iterative linearized inversion scheme to suppress migration artifacts, deconvolve the source signature, mitigate the acquisition fingerprint, and enhance the spatial resolution of migrated images. The problem with least-squares migration of primaries, however, is that it may not be able to enhance events that are mainly illuminated by internal multiples, such as vertical and nearly vertical faults or salt flanks. To alleviate this problem, we adopted a linearized inversion framework to migrate internally scattered energy. We apply the least-squares migration of first-order internal multiples to image subsurface vertical fault planes. Tests on synthetic data demonstrated the ability of the proposed method to resolve vertical fault planes, which are poorly illuminated by the least-squares migration of primaries only. The proposed scheme is robust in the presence of white Gaussian observational noise and in the case of imaging the fault planes using inaccurate migration velocities. Our results suggested that the proposed least-squares imaging, under the double-scattering assumption, still retrieved the vertical fault planes when imaging the scattered data despite a slight defocusing of these events due to the presence of noise or velocity errors.",10.1190/geo2014-0436.1
Ore Body Size Determination In Electrical Prospecting,A method of determination of the size of ore body associated with a mineralized intersection is presented which utilizes the primary voltage disturbance created by the body and the variation of the disturbance with electrode spacing. The form of the disturbance function is compared with theoretical curves based on the oblate spheroid.,10.1190/1.1437825
Tracking Of Velocity Variations At Depth In The Presence Of Surface Velocity Fluctuations,"We tested a small-scale experiment that is dedicated to the study of the wave separation algorithm and to the velocity variations monitoring problem itself. It handles the case in which velocity variations at depth are hidden by near-surface velocity fluctuations. Using an acquisition system that combines an array of sources and an array of receivers, coupled with controlled velocity variations, we tested the ability of beam-forming techniques to track velocity variations separately for body waves and surface waves. After wave separation through double beam forming, the arrival time variations of the different waves were measured through the phase difference between the extracted wavelets. Finally, a method was tested to estimate near-surface velocity variations using surface waves or shallow reflection and compute a correction to isolate target velocity variations at depth.",10.1190/geo2012-0071.1
The Application Of A Three‐Element Model To The S.P. And Resistivity Phenomena Evinced By Dirty Sands,"A simple resistor model consisting of three elements in parallel and representing (a) an element of solution and conducting solid particles in series, (b) an element of the solid particles only, and (c) an element of solution only, explains satisfactorily the experimental relationship between the conductivities of solutions used to saturate synthetic dirty sands and the conductivities of the saturated sands. The synthetic dirty sands consist of beds of ion‐exchange particles. The same model is applied to give a theoretical explanation of the potential differences between two different solutions when these meet in the interstices of a synthetic dirty sand; excellent agreement is observed between theory and experiment. It is found that both potentials and resistivities depend on the same geometrical parameters. Hence they can be related to each other. The relationship is derived between the self‐potential deflection and the resistivities of rock and invaded zone. It is compared to various formulae proposed by other investigators for interpreting logs in dirty sands. Conductivities and potential differences across plugs of ""synthetic dirty sands"" containing oil have been measured. At high oil saturations the potential differences are almost as high as those across a solid membrane containing the same ion‐exchange resin.",10.1190/1.1438201
Amplitude And Avo Responses Of A Single Thin Bed,"The seismic reflection characterizations of a thin layer are important for reservoir geophysics. However, discussions on the reflection for a thin layer are usually restricted to precritical angle incidence. In this work, an exact analytical solution is derived to model the reflection amplitude and amplitude variation with offset (AVO) responses of a single thin bed for arbitrary incident angles. The results show that the influence of an ultra‐thin bed is great for opposite‐polarity reflections and is small for identical‐polarity reflections. Opposite‐polarity precritical reflection amplitudes first decrease in magnitude with the wavelength/thickness ratio to a local minimum, then increase to a maximum, and finally decrease gradually to zero as the layer vanishes. Opposite‐polarity postcritical reflections monotonically decrease from near unity to zero, proportional to the thickness of the layer. Identical‐polarity precritical reflection amplitudes first increase in magnitude with the wavelength/thickness ratio to a local maximum, then decrease to a minimum, and finally increase to the amplitude of a single bottom reflection when the layer vanishes. Identical‐polarity postcritical reflections have magnitudes near unity. The AVO responses for both opposite and identical‐polarity acoustic thin beds gradually increase with angle. The influence of the Poisson's ratio of the thin bed is small for either small incidence angles or thicknesses less than 7% of the seismic wavelength, but is large for high incidence angles or thicknesses greater than 13% of the wavelength. A decrease of Poisson's ratio causes a pronounced AVO response that reaches its maximum at the quarter‐wavelength tuning thickness.",10.1190/1.1598108
Critical Porosity And Elastic Properties Of Microporous Mixed Carbonate-Siliciclastic Rocks,"By integrating elastic-property measurements and quantitative mineralogic and petrographic analyses of 45 mixed carbonate-siliciclastic samples from two wells drilled in Late Cretaceous rock of the South Provence Basin (southeast France), we can (1) identify and quantify the parameters controlling elastic properties; (2) demonstrate that micrite can be considered as a porous medium with a low critical porosity, averaging 18%; and (3) relate diagenetic transformations, pore-structure modifications, and elastic-property changes. Microporous carbonates with compact anhedral and euhedral microrhombic micrites display a steeper decrease in compressional and shear velocities with increasing porosity than do carbonate rocks with moldic, intergranular, or intercrystalline macroporosity. The low value of critical porosity estimated in micrites (18%), as well as the steep slopes of velocity-porosity relationships at low porosity, is believed to result from a pore-network geometry characterized by very flat, thin pores bounded by planar faces of micrite crystals. Cementation of microrhombic micrite steeply increases elastic moduli, whereas dissolution processes significantly increase porosity with low variations of elastic moduli. Thus, critical-porosity concepts can help describe and model elastic properties of micritic microporous carbonate.",10.1190/1.3043727
Quantifying The Uncertainty In An Avo Interpretation,"Lithologic interpretations of amplitude variation with offset (AVO) information are ambiguous both because different lithologies occupy overlapping ranges of elastic properties, and because angle‐dependent reflection coefficients estimated from seismic data are uncertain. This paper presents a method for quantifying and combining these two components of uncertainty to get a full characterization of the uncertainty associated with an AVO‐based lithologic interpretation. The result of this approach is a compilation of all the lithologies that are consistent with the observed AVO behavior, along with a probability of occurrence for each lithology. A 2‐D line from the North Sea illustrates how the method might be applied in practice. For any data set, the interaction between the geologic and measurement components of uncertainty may significantly affect the overall uncertainty in a lithologic interpretation.",10.1190/1.1451395
The Amount And Distribution Of Seismic And Gravity Exploration In The Gulf Coast Through 1936,"Maps are presented to show the accumulated density of exploration by the reflection seismograph and the torsion balance for one hundred fourteen counties and parishes comprising the Gulf Coasts of Texas and Louisiana. The conclusion is drawn that the conspicuous overruns of exploration for these two methods indicated by this survey are a natural consequence of complete surveys for this area by these companies exploring on a coastwide scale. These coastwide coverages represent prospect discovery by the method in question, and are considered to be good practice in view of the probable introduction of new methods of higher finding power.",10.1190/1.1438060
Elimination Of Secondary Pressure Pulses In Offshore Exploration (A Model Study),"The behavior of the gas bubble generated by explosive charges fired below the ocean's surface has been studied by means of a scale model. The motion of the bubble was recorded using a high‐speed camera. A small pressure detector was used to record the pressure variation near the bubble. The behavior of the bubble generated by the equivalent of a 15‐lb charge was studied with the bubble subjected to the following boundary conditions: a single charge at various depths below the liquid surface, two charges on a vertical axis at various separations and various depths, two charges on a horizontal axis at various separations, a single charge at various separations below a solid plate, and a single charge at various separations to the side of the solid cylinder. Of these methods, the only one which appeared promising was the location of two charges on a vertical axis with both charges within 20 ft of the surface.",10.1190/1.1438491
Induced-Polarization Detection And Mapping Of Contaminant Plumes,"Several laboratory and scaled model investigations suggest that organic contaminants affect the surface electrical properties of exposed soils/rocks and therefore produce measurable induced polarization (IP) signatures. However, there is little field evidence of an IP methodology for contaminant mapping. A 2D time-domain IP method is developed for mapping the FS-12 contaminant plume at the Massachusetts Military Reservation (MMR) located in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The FS-12 plume consists of approximately   265  m3    of fuel that erupted from a broken underground pipeline in the early 1970s. Benzene and ethylene dibromide (EDB) are the primary contaminants at FS-12, with concentrations exceeding the allowed maximum concentration levels (MCL), while other constituents of the plume did not exceed their MCL. Therefore, the contaminants of interest are benzene and EDB, partly because of their health risk and partly because they present the highest concentrations (2400 and   1000 μg∕L  , respectively) among the plume constituents and are therefore more likely to be related to the polarization source. IP data were acquired along a survey line that partially transects the plume extending over contaminated and uncontaminated zones and were inverted to give 2D resistivity and chargeability plots to   100 m   depth and a horizontal extent of   400 m  . By separately inverting IP data derived from time windows located at short and long decay times, a time-domain gross (spectral) chargeability difference is produced. Both the chargeability and gross spectral chargeability difference show good agreement with the known location of the plume from monitoring wells, with the IP chargeability section suggesting contaminant distribution detail that cannot otherwise be inferred from the sparse borehole distribution.",10.1190/1.2196873
Note On The Transmission Of Radio Waves Through The Earth,Experiments are described and data reported on the attenuation suffered by radio signals in passing through shallow layers of the earth. Comparison is made between the measured attenuations and values computed from published formulae.,10.1190/1.1445022
"Effects Of Fractal Fluctuations In Topographic Relief, Permittivity And Conductivity On Ground‐Penetrating Radar Antenna Radiation","Typical ground‐penetrating radar (GPR) transmitters and receivers are dipole antennas. These antennas have pronounced directivity properties and exhibit strong coupling to interfaces across which there are changes in electric material properties. Antenna coupling to the surface of idealized half‐space models has been the subject of intense research for several decades. In contrast, the behavior of antennas in the vicinity of interfaces with realistic topographic fluctuations and/or subsurface heterogeneities has been largely unexplored. To explore this issue, we simulate the responses of a typical surface GPR antenna system located on a suite of realistic fractal earth models using the finite‐difference time‐domain (FDTD) method. The models are characterized by topographic roughness of the air–soil interface and small‐scale heterogeneous distributions of permittivity and conductivity in the subsurface. Synthetic radiation patterns and input impedance values of the simulated GPR antenna system demonstrate that topographic roughness significantly affects the coupling of the antenna to the ground, whereas heterogeneities in the subsurface predominantly influence the antenna radiation through scattering and absorption along the propagation path.",10.1190/1.1635047
Plane‐Layer Prestack Inversion In The Presence Of Surface Reverberation,"Experiments with synthetic data have indicated that generalized linear inversion may be used to estimate compressional velocities as a function of depth with high resolution directly from band‐limited, unstacked data. The ocean surface was not included in these experiments. In the presence of strong surface multiples, inversion is expected to take longer and be less accurate, because events from multiple surface reflections overlie primary events and normally have differing moveout. Existing velocity‐analysis techniques rely on the ability of an observer to make the difficult distinction between multiples and primaries. Equations are provided for adding the surface to the inversion procedure. This involves adding the surface effects to the Jacobian matrix as well as to the forward modeling procedure. To speed computation, the addition of the surface effects to the Jacobian matrix is delayed until after the matrix has been multiplied by a vector in the linear‐equation solution. Absorption is added to the inversion to represent the real world more closely and to improve computation speed by reducing sampling requirements. Realistic synthetic band‐limited data with high surface reverberation content were generated from a well‐log velocity profile. The inversion recovered the velocity profile to within 3 percent when a velocity increasing linearly with depth was used as a starting profile. The error in the model‐generated seismogram converges from 100 percent to within 2 percent of the reference data. The positions of interfaces are located more accurately at greater depths than at shallower depths because more sensors are observing deep strata than shallow strata. Convergence is to within 0.1 percent of that of the reference data at the maximum depth. The computation required 25 iterations and a total time of 66 hours on a DEC VAX 11/780. Reducing this time should be possible. In a preliminary study of the effects of noise, additive Gaussian noise was seen to limit the accuracy of the velocity estimate monotonically as the variance of the added noise was increased.",10.1190/1.1442225
Converted-Wave Splitting Estimation And Compensation,"Converted-wave (C-wave) splitting estimation and compensation (SEAC) estimates and removes the effects of shear-wave splitting from C-wave data. A locally 1D earth is assumed where a priori rotation of the field data to radial-transverse coordinates is valid. Subsurface fractures (horizontal transverse isotropy [HTI] layers are assumed) polarize C-wave reflection energy onto the transverse component, and introduce azimuth-dependent traveltime variations to the radial component. SEAC estimates the fast principal direction of the fractures, and the amount of traveltime splitting, from input radial and transverse azimuth-sectored stacks. SEAC also produces a splitting-compensated radial component, and a data misfit transverse component. Local fracture variations not accounted for in the coarse-interval inversion may be interpreted in the data misfit. Synthetic data generated by anisotropic reflectivity modeling for a model containing two HTI layers having different principal directions was used to illustrate SEAC. The field data example used was from a large3-C, 3D Vectorseis survey from onshore China. Preprocessed C-wave data (radial and transverse components) were prestack time migrated into offset planes within 10-degree azimuth sectors. These data were then corrected for residual moveout (azimuth-independent correction), and stacked over offset to produce azimuth-sectored stack gathers that were input to SEAC. SEAC estimated the azimuth of the fast principal direction  ϕfast  and the amount of traveltime splitting   Δ tsplit    that describe the overburden anisotropy. Spatially variable parameter estimates for the entire 3D data set, (   ϕfast =90°±20°   and   Δ tsplit =28±20 ms  ), produce significantly reduced energy on the transverse component at all record times after inversion. Azimuth-dependent traveltime variations on the input radial data were also significantly reduced at all record times, resulting in a postinversion radial full-azimuth stack having improved reflection continuity and temporal bandwidth. The data misfit (transverse component after inversion) potentially revealed local variations in shear-wave splitting not accounted for by the overburden layer-stripping correction.",10.1190/1.3036009
Head Waves From A Bed Of Finite Thickness,"The behavior of the head wave from a high‐speed layer embedded in a low‐speed half‐space has been investigated with two‐dimensional seismic models. Twelve layer thicknesses ranging from four wavelengths to one‐tenth wavelength were used. A simple theory based on interference between the head wave and the reflections from the bottom of the layer gave amplitude‐distance values which agreed with the observations for layer thicknesses down to about one‐third of a wavelength. For thick layers, the experimental amplitude dependence on distance was different from the theoretical law (−3/2 power of the distance). The velocity minimum for thin layers discovered by Lavergne was confirmed and a possible slight velocity maximum at intermediate layer thicknesses noted. The velocity for zero layer thickness appeared to be greater than the free bar velocity. Systematic variations of head‐wave spectra with layer thickness occurred.",10.1190/1.1439096
Structure Of The Seg Point Data Exchange And Field Formats (A Proposed Seg Digital Recording Standard)—Specification,"Editor's Note: This is an interim report from the Potential Fields and Positioning Subcommittee. Comment is invited. Technological progress in all fields of endeavor depends upon three things—namely, methodology, metrology, and standardization. The aim of this paper is to contribute a proposed standard in the belief that it will reduce a great deal of tedious effort that authors are all too familiar with and make a small contribution to the geophysical state of the art.",10.1190/1.1440823
"High-Resolution Passive Seismic Tomography For 3D Velocity, Poisson'S Ratio Ν, And P-Wave Quality Qp In The Delvina Hydrocarbon Field, Southern Albania","We have studied using traveltimes of P- and S-waves and initial seismic-pulse rise-time measurements from natural microearthquakes to derive 3D P-wave velocity VP information (mostly structural) as well as P- and S-wave velocity VP/VS and P-wave quality factor QP information (mostly lithologic) in a known hydrocarbon field in southern Albania. During a 12-month monitoring period, 1860 microearthquakes were located at a 50-station seismic network and were used to obtain the above parameters. The data set included earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from –0.1 to 3.0 R (Richter scale) and focal depths typically occurring between 2 and 10 km. Kohonen neural networks were implemented to facilitate the lithological classification of the passive seismic tomography (PST) results. The obtained results, which agreed with data from nearby wells, helped delineate the structure of the reservoir. Two subregions of the investigated area, one corresponding to an oil field and one to a gas field, were correlated with the PST results. This experiment showed that PST is a powerful new geophysical technique for exploring regions that present seismic penetration problems, difficult topographies, and complicated geologies, such as thrust-belt regions. The method is economical and environmentally friendly, and it can be used to investigate very large regions for the optimal design of planned 2D or 3D conventional geophysical surveys.",10.1190/1.3560016
A New Method For The Automatic Interpretation Of Schlumberger And Wenner Sounding Curves,"A fast iterative method for the automatic interpretation of Schlumberger and Wenner sounding curves is based on obtaining interpreted depths and resistivities from shifted electrode spacings and adjusted apparent resistivities, respectively. The method is fully automatic. It does not require an initial guess of the number of layers, their thicknesses, or their resistivities; and it does not require extrapolation of incomplete sounding curves. The number of layers in the interpreted model equals the number of digitized points on the sounding curve. The resulting multilayer model is always well‐behaved with no thin layers of unusually high or unusually low resistivities. For noisy data, interpretation is done in two sets of iterations (two passes). Anomalous layers, created because of noise in the first pass, are eliminated in the second pass. Such layers are eliminated by considering the best‐fitting curve from the first pass to be a smoothed version of the observed curve and automatically reinterpreting it (second pass). The application of the method is illustrated by several examples.",10.1190/1.1442648
"The Nth‐Root Stack: Theory, Applications, And Examples","Multichannel geophysical data are usually stacked by calculating the average of the observations on all channels. In the Nth‐root stack, the average of the Nth root of each observation is raised to the Nth power, with the signs of the observations and average maintained. When N = 1, the process is identical to conventional linear stacking or averaging. Nth‐root stacking has been applied in the processing of seismic refraction and teleseismic array data. In some experiments and certain applications it is inferior to linear stacking, but in others it is superior. Although the variance for an Nth‐root stack is typically less than for a linear stack, the mean square error is larger, because of signal attenuation. The fractional amount by which the signal is attenuated depends in a complicated way on the number of data channels, the order (N) of the stack, the signal‐to‐noise ratio, and the noise distribution. Because the signal‐to‐noise ratio varies across a wavelet, peaking where the signal is greatest and approaching zero at the zero‐crossing points, the attenuation of the signal varies across a wavelet, thereby producing signal distortion. The main visual effect of the distortion is a sharpening of the legs of the wavelet. However, the attenuation of the signal is accompanied by a much greater attenuation of the background noise, leading to a significant contrast enhancement. It is this sharpening of the signal, accompanied by the contrast enhancement, that makes the technique powerful in beam‐steering applications of array data. For large values of N, the attenuation of the signal with low signal‐to‐noise ratios ultimately leads to its destruction. Nth‐root stacking is therefore particularly powerful in applications where signal sharpening and contrast enhancement are important but signal distortion is not.",10.1190/1.1442045
Outcrop Topography As A Proxy Of Acoustic Impedance In Synthetic Seismograms,"Two‐dimensional seismic models of geologic data are usually based on simplified impedance functions: large ""seismic‐scale"" lithologic blocks exhibit uniform impedance values, and abrupt changes in impedance occur at the boundaries of these lithologic blocks. For outcrop‐based seismic models, erosional slope topography may be one possible proxy for impedance that is relatively easy to measure in outcrop. In this paper, we use terrestrial photogrammetric techniques to establish the relationship between outcrop topography, expressed as the rock slope angle, and impedance for a marl‐limestone terrain in the Vercors, southeast France. The photogrammetric surveys were combined with sedimentologic descriptions and petrophysical measurements (including P‐wave velocity, bulk‐density, clay content, and porosity). The slope angle along a particular vertical profile was then converted into a pseudoimpedance log, which was subsequently used to construct 1-D synthetic seismograms. A comparison of these new seismograms with published seismic models of the same area revealed the benefits of the new approach, in particular for seismic modeling using high‐frequency source wavelets.",10.1190/1.1444094
A Proposed Geophysical Program Of Exploration For Nebraska And The Dakotas,"The known geological information, particularly with reference to possible oil‐producing horizons, is discussed briefly. A method is proposed whereby the area is subjected to a reconnaissance seismic survey to determine the location of the major structural features, followed by other methods of successively higher resolving power in the favorable areas outlined by the reconnaissance.",10.1190/1.1437091
3D Seismic Image Processing For Unconformities,"In seismic images, an unconformity can be first identified by reflector terminations (i.e., truncation, toplap, onlap, or downlap), and then it can be traced downdip to its corresponding correlative conformity, or updip to a parallel unconformity; for example, in topsets. Unconformity detection is a significant aspect of seismic stratigraphic interpretation, but most automatic methods work only in 2D and can only detect angular unconformities with reflector terminations. Moreover, unconformities pose challenges for automatic techniques used in seismic interpretation. First, it is difficult to accurately estimate normal vectors or slopes of seismic reflectors at an unconformity with multioriented structures due to reflector terminations. Second, seismic flattening methods cannot correctly flatten reflectors at unconformities that represent hiatuses or geologic age gaps. We have developed a 3D unconformity attribute computed from a seismic amplitude image to detect unconformities by highlighting the angular unconformities and corresponding parallel unconformities or correlative conformities. These detected unconformity surfaces were further used as constraints for a structure-tensor method to more accurately estimate seismic normal vectors at unconformities. Finally, using detected unconformities as constraints and more accurate normal vectors, we could better flatten seismic images with unconformities.",10.1190/geo2014-0323.1
Extended Walton Third-Order Elastic Coefficients Modified By An Anisotropic And Stress-Dependent Coordination Number,"Relating subsurface stress to velocity anisotropy can provide quantitative insight into the effects of reservoir production. Rock-physics models using effective medium theory for unconsolidated sands can be built to establish this link, although empirical corrections are often required. In pursuit of this goal, fractional changes in elastic moduli have been related to fractional changes in stress through a perturbation analysis of the extended Walton model. The stress path considered was composed of isotropic loading followed by an arbitrary stress perturbation. The coefficients derived are dependent on granular elastic moduli and the proportion of grains with no-slip contacts but are conveniently independent of strain and porosity. A modification of these relationships has been introduced using an anisotropic stress-dependent coordination number, whose parameters can be derived from isotropic moduli-stress experiments. The inclusion of an anisotropic coordination number improved the model's fit to experimental results of unconsolidated sands subject to anisotropic loading.",10.1190/geo2013-0127.1
Adaptive Focusing Window For Seismic Angle Migration,"Kirchhoff migration is based on a continuous integral ranging from minus infinity to plus infinity. The necessary discretization and truncation of this integral introduces noise in the migrated image. The attenuation of this noise has been studied by many authors who propose different strategies. The main idea is to limit the migration operator around the specular point. This means that the specular point must be known before migration and that a criterion exists to determine the size of the migration operator. We propose an original approach to estimate the size of the focusing window, knowing the geologic dip. The approach benefits from the use of prestack depth migration in angle domain, which is recognized as the most artifact-free Kirchhoff-type migration. The main advantages of the method are ease of implementation in an existing angle-migration code (two or three dimensions), user friendliness, ability to take into account multiorientation of the local geology as in faulted regions, and flexibility with respect to the quality of the estimated geologic dip field. Common-image gathers resulting from the method are free from migration noise and can be postprocessed in an easier way. We validate the approach and its possibilities on synthetic data examples with different levels of complexity.",10.1190/1.3002768
"Density‐Based Reflectivity In Seismic Exploration For Coal In Alberta, Canada","At a coal field in central Alberta, Canada, the acoustic reflectivity of shallow coal seams was found to be dominated by the density contrast between coal and host bentonitic sediments. Sonic logs and a check‐shot survey showed that the compressional‐wave velocity is almost constant through the coal zone and the overlying sediments, and ranges in value between 2000 m/s and 2350 m/s over different parts of the coal field. The average coal density is 1400kg/m3, whereas the density of the sediments is about 2200kg/m3. Results are illustrated using logs from a typical drillhole in the coal field. At this location, the time reflectivity sequence based on both the density and sonic logs is very similar to that obtained when the density log only is used, with a constant velocity assumed through the coal zone. At another drillhole location in the coal field, where reflection seismic data had been acquired, a synthetic seismogram generated from the density log closely matches the stacked seismic section.",10.1190/1.1442950
Gravity Anomaly Separation By Wiener Filtering,"We introduce a gravity anomaly separation method based on frequency‐domain Wiener filtering. Gravity anomaly separation can be effected by such wavelength filtering when the gravity response from the geologic feature of interest (the signal) dominates one region (or spectral band) of the observed gravity field's power spectrum. The Wiener filter is preferable to a conventional band‐pass filter because geologic information from the study area can be incorporated to a greater extent in specifying the filter's transfer function. Our method differs from previous Wiener filtering schemes in that it provides, through direct modeling of known geology (e.g., outcrop and borehole data), a more objective estimate of the signal power spectrum required for defining the transfer function of the filter. We illustrate the technique first with synthetic data, and then with a field example from the southern Paradox basin. The Paradox basin example reveals the limitation inherent to all wavelength filtering which results from spectral overlap between the gravity signal and the spectral contributions of other geologic sources. In the study area, significant spectral overlap occurs between the gravity effects of sources in the Precambrian basement and the gravity signal arising from the density contrast across the Mississippian‐Pennsylvanian interface.",10.1190/1.1442865
Time-Domain Modeling Of Electromagnetic Diffusion With A Frequency-Domain Code,"We modeled time-domain EM measurements of induction currents for marine and land applications with a frequency-domain code. An analysis of the computational complexity of a number of numerical methods shows that frequency-domain modeling followed by a Fourier transform is an attractive choice if a sufficiently powerful solver is available. A recently developed, robust multigrid solver meets this requirement. An interpolation criterion determined the automatic selection of frequencies. The skin depth controlled the construction of the computational grid at each frequency. Tests of the method against exact solutions for some simple problems and a realistic marine example demonstrate that a limited number of frequencies suffice to provide time-domain solutions after piecewise-cubic Hermite interpolation and a fast Fourier transform.",10.1190/1.2799093
Multifrequency Turam Measurements Over A Sulfide Deposit,"A six‐frequency electromagnetic (EM) system has been developed and used for a Turam‐type survey over the sulfide deposit of Mailaram copper belt in Andhra Pradesh, India. Turam field strength ratio (FSR) and phase difference (PD) are measured in the range 84 to 2688 Hz. Sulfides in this belt occur as thin concentrated lodes which grade into disseminations. Soil covers a major part of the area. Interpretation of the results is carried out using a thin sheet model in free space. However, an attempt has been made to account for finite resistivity of the normal ground by computing Turam response of a conducting half‐space appropriate for the area and subtracting the same from the observed response. The results of the survey confirm the known advantage of the Turam method, viz., its greater depth of investigation compared to a method like Slingram. The normal ground at Mailaram is only mildly conducting so that the free‐air approximation is valid at low frequencies. A correction for the finite resistivity of the ground is required only at high frequencies. However, the limitation of a single‐body interpretation scheme for the bedrock conductor is well brought out by the results.",10.1190/1.1441265
The Borehole Controlled‐Source Audiomagnetotelluric Response Of A Three‐Dimensional Fracture Zone,"Approximate theoretical borehole CSAMT profiles of the normalized vertical electric and magnetic fields Ez/Hx0 and Hz/Hy0 were computed for several models of practical interest using a 3-D MT computer program based on the method of integral equations. Hx0 and Hy0 are the horizontal fields measured at the surface. A conductive tabular prism in a layered and homogeneous half‐space was chosen to simulate a 3-D fracture zone composed of individual, interconnected fractures. Model parameters varied during this study were depth and dip of the tabular body, the conductivity and layering of the half‐space, the frequency of the plane‐wave source, and the separation between the borehole and target. In addition, a model composed of two horizontal prisms was investigated. Decreasing the host conductivity, the depth of the prism, or the separation between the borehole and prism increases the magnitude of the subsurface normalized vertical electric and magnetic fields. Depth to the top of a dipping prism in a half‐space can be determined from the crossover of the profile of the Ez/Hx0 real component. Peak amplitudes of the Hz/Hy0 profiles provide information about the location of the maximum current density within the prism, which is quite variable for the imaginary component. There is no simple relationship between a small borehole‐to‐prism separation and the separation between the antisymmetric peaks of the Ez/Hx0 profiles. Without knowledge of the borehole‐to‐prism separation, the dip of a nonhorizontal prism cannot be determined accurately. However, the down‐dip side of a dipping prism is indicated by the larger peak anomaly in the real component of the profile. The normalized Ez anomalies of the conductive prism seem more sensitive to body position and also to variation in the host resistivity than are the normalized Hz anomalies, thus making the former parameter more susceptible to geologic noise. The resistivity of the half‐space and overburden and the frequency of the source significantly influence the amplitude and phase of the secondary electric fields. Current channeling is a significant contributor to the response of the prism within a half‐space of even moderate resistivity at frequencies of 10 to 100 Hz. The Hz/Hy0 field is little influenced by horizontal layering, so the borehole profiles reflect mainly subsurface inhomogeneities. The two main advantages of this technique are that the signal is much larger than the level of natural‐field noise and data acquisition is rapid because of the high frequency of the source (10–1000 Hz). However, the borehole profiles can be significantly affected by nearby inhomogeneities and by the incident field when the borehole and sensor are not vertically aligned.",10.1190/1.1442457
A New Electromagnetic Field Technique,"A technique has been developed for accurate location of narrow vertical or inclined structures such as joints, fault planes, mineralized fissures, and weathered dykes. An alternating current of audio‐frequency is introduced conductively into the ground at a center‐point. Relative or absolute measurements of the tangential component of the resultant horizontal electromagnetic field are made at stations on concentric circles around the center‐point. Curves of the amplitudes, in decibels, are plotted as ordinates against the station positions. These are called the HT‐curves. The locations of peaks occurring vertically above current concentrations in narrow conducting zones are plotted on a map of the area and corresponding peaks are easily joined up to delineate such structures. Phase measurements have proved to be of minor importance for the location of geologic structures.",10.1190/1.1438147
Monitoring A Shallow Subsurface Gas Flow By Time-Lapse Refraction Analysis,"Studying time-lapse time shifts for refracted events is a complementary method to conventional 4D analysis. Especially for detecting changes in relatively shallow subsurface layers, we find that this method has potential. By studying data associated with an old underground blowout, we find consistent time shifts of up to 4 ms when comparing a base survey that was acquired before the underground blowout with a monitor survey acquired 20 months after the blowout. These time shifts are interpreted as caused by shallow gas migration. The 4D refraction time shifts are estimated by a standard windowed crosscorrelation technique. Observed time shifts are compared with a simple synthetic modeling to find the possible property and location of the anomaly. The synthetic result was qualitatively matched with real data. We believe that more quantitative matches can obtained when the method is combined with full waveform inversions. Time-lapse refraction analysis has some clear limitations, for instance, the presence of refracted events, which requires a positive velocity contrast for the interface to be studied. Another limitation is that for deeper events, the signal from shallower refractions and noise associated with the water layer will distort the 4D time shifts. However, we found that these results demonstrate the potential of refraction time shifts as a complementary 4D analysis technique. We believe that the method has a significant potential for quantitative 4D interpretation.",10.1190/geo2011-0012.1
On The Thermal Instability Of Large Diameter Wells—An Observational Report,"A fluid in a tube subjected to a thermal gradient will be stable as long as this gradient does not exceed a certain critical value. Observational evidence is presented that the fluid in large diameter wells, such as oil wells, subjected to the normal geothermal gradient is, indeed, unstable as predicted by the theory. Our independent observations support the evidence presented by Diment (1967) in a companion paper.",10.1190/1.1439886
"Baubee Lake Test Site, Ontario, Canada","The author, in conjunction with the University of Manitoba, has established a geophysics test site in the Canadian Shield at Baubee Lake, Ontario. The location of the site is shown in Figures 1 and 2. The availability of the site to industry and universities was announced in the Canadian literature last year.

The Mit Geophysical Analysis Group (Gag): 1954 And Beyond,"The MIT Geophysical Analysis Group (GAG) laid the groundwork for the so-called ""digital revolution"" in exploration seismology. Enders Robinson traces in this issue GAG's history from its earliest days till 1954; here, the story continues with GAG's subsequent evolution until its end in 1957. But that was just the beginning — during the 1960s and 1970s, the new digital technology spread throughout the oil and service industries worldwide, making it possible to develop progressively more sophisticated seismic processing and imaging algorithms that permanently changed the landscape of geophysical exploration.",10.1190/1.1993707
"Impact Factors, Citations, And Geophysics","This review assesses the contributions and impact that GEOPHYSICS journal has made to both the theory and the applications of exploration geophysics during its publication life span. The contributions are evaluated first on the basis of Journal Citation Reports data, which summarize information available since 1975 about the impact factor of our journal. The impact factor for GEOPHYSICS in 1975–2002 has ranged between 1.461 and 0.591, with an average of 0.924 and with a relative ranking between 16 and 45 for all journals in its category. The journal receiving the highest impact factor for the period 2000–2003 in the ""Geochemistry and Geophysics"" category is Reviews of Geophysics, with an average impact factor of 7.787 and which ranged between 9.226 and 6.083. A second and important criterion is the frequency with which individual papers published in GEOPHYSICS have been cited elsewhere. This information is available for the entire publication history of GEOPHYSICS and supports the choices made for the early classic papers. These were listed in both the Silver and the Golden Anniversary issues of GEOPHYSICS. In August 2004, the five most-cited papers in GEOPHYSICS published in the time period 1936 to February 2003 are Thomsen (1986) with 423 citations, Constable et al. (1987) with 380 citations, Cagniard (1953) with 354 citations, Sen et al. (1981) with 313 citations, and Stolt (1978) with 307 citations. Fifteen more papers exceed a threshold value of 200 citations. During 2000–2002, GEOPHYSICS, Geophysical Prospecting, Geophysical Journal International, and Journal of Applied Geophysics were the four journals with the highest number of citations of papers published in GEOPHYSICS. In the same 2000–2002 period, those journals in which papers published in GEOPHYSICS are cited most are GEOPHYSICS, Geophysical Prospecting, Geophysical Journal International, and Journal of Geophysical Research. During 1985, the total number of citations in all journals in the Science Citation Index database to papers published in GEOPHYSICS was 2657. By 2002, this same citation count for GEOPHYSICS had increased to 4784.",10.1190/1.1897303
The Response Of A Disk In A Dipole Field,"Electromagnetic type curves are basic tools in mining geophysics in reducing ambiguity of interpretation. To this end, a mathematical solution is given for the quasi‐static response of an infinitely conducting disk in a dipolar magnetic field. The solution, which emerges as a series solution of Laplace's equation in oblate spheroidal co‐ordinates, converges rapidly enough only in certain ranges of radii of the disk. Sommerfeld's image method leads to an alternate solution that is exact. For finite conductivity, the mathematics becomes rather unwieldy, so experimental modelling produced the type curves in this range. By using high frequencies and aluminum disks, ""infinitely"" conducting models were constructed to check the theoretical solutions. All computation was done on an IBM 650 digital computer.",10.1190/1.1438895
Fictitious Anomalies Of Higher Vertical Derivatives Of Gravity,"Computation of the first and second vertical derivatives of gravity gives rise to anomalies which look as though they were evidence of local geological features which, in fact, do not exist. Such anomalies are called fictitious anomalies. An average of two to four fictitious anomalies appear for every true anomaly. Fictitious anomalies are often so strongly defined as to mislead the geophysicist. In this paper an attempt is made to show how fictitious anomalies occur. This makes evident certain limitations in the method of interpreting gravity by computing derivatives.",10.1190/1.1439694
"Integrated Prestack Depth Migration Of Vertical Seismic Profile And Surface Seismic Data From The Rocky Mountain Foothills Of Southern Alberta, Canada","We have developed an anisotropic prestack depth migration code that can migrate either vertical seismic profile (VSP) or surface seismic data. We use this migration code in a new method for integrated VSP and surface seismic depth imaging. Instead of splicing the VSP image into the section derived from surface seismic data, we use the same migration algorithm and a single velocity model to migrate both data sets to a common output grid. We then scale and sum the two images to yield one integrated depth‐migrated section. After testing this method on synthetic surface seismic and VSP data, we applied it to field data from a 2D surface seismic line and a multioffset VSP from the Rocky Mountain Foothills of southern Alberta, Canada. Our results show that the resulting integrated image exhibits significant improvement over that obtained from (a) the migration of either data set alone or (b) the conventional splicing approach. The integrated image uses the broader frequency bandwidth of the VSP data to provide higher vertical resolution than the migration of the surface seismic data. The integrated image also shows enhanced structural detail, since no part of the surface seismic section is eliminated, and good event continuity through the use of a single migration–velocity model, obtained by an integrated interpretation of borehole and surface seismic data. This enhanced migrated image enabled us to perform a more robust interpretation with good well ties.",10.1190/1.1635031
Recursive Prestack Depth Migration Using Cfp Gathers,"The common-focus-point technology (CFP) describes prestack migration by focusing in two steps: emission and detection. The output of the first focusing step represents a CFP gather. This gather defines a shot record that represents the subsurface response resulting from a focused source wavefield. We propose applying the recursive shot-record, depth-migration algorithm to the CFP gathers of a seismic data volume and refer to this process as CFP-gather migration. In the situation of complex geology and/or low signal-to-noise ratio, CFP-based image gathers are easier to interpret for nonalignment than the conventional image gathers. This makes the CFP-based image gathers better suited for velocity analysis. This important property is illustrated by examples on the Marmousi model.",10.1190/1.2348517
Shear Slowness Measurement By Dispersive Processing Of The Borehole Flexural Mode,"In sonic well logging, the flexural mode generated by a dipole transducer allows measurement of shear slowness in slow formations, that is, formations in which the shear slowness is slower than the borehole fluid speed. The flexural mode is a dispersive borehole mode, but many current processing methods do not account for this dispersion. The approximate semblance equation is derived to explain what happens when a dispersive wave is processed nondispersively. The processing described here is a dispersive analog of the slowness‐time coherence (STC) processing used commonly for array sonic waveforms. It back‐propagates waveforms according to model dispersion curves and calculates semblance. It is a specialized version of the maximum likelihood (ML) and least‐mean‐squared‐error (LMSE) estimator for formation shear slowness. The dispersive analog of STC is too slow for depth‐by‐depth logging but may be a helpful analytic tool. A high‐speed variant, dispersive STC (DSTC), eliminates this difficulty by a new window‐positioning technique and can be faster than STC. DSTC results based on data from a real‐axis integration model show that the technique measures the formation shear slowness with small bias because of windowing and other arrivals. Results are presented from two wells logged with a dipole sonic tool. A log from a fast formation shows that shear slownesses measured from the flexural mode by DSTC agree with monopole results. A log from a slow formation is also presented.",10.1190/1.1444333
Electromagnetic Response Of An Embedded Cylinder For Line Current Excitation,"Numerical results obtained from an extension of D'Yakonov's (1959) exact solution for the case of a buried horizontal circular cylinder, excited by a horizontal line source of current above the surface of a uniform half‐space and parallel to the axis of the buried cylinder, are analyzed. Results show the field impedance (Ex/Hy), the ratio of the vertical magnetic component to the horizontal magnetic component (Hz/Hy) as well as the corresponding phase differences at the surface for a range of periods (T = 0.25 to 2 hours), varying cylinder conductivity (σ2=1to100Sm-1) and cylinder radii (a = 0.5 and 25 km). The results have possible application in the interpretation of long period magnetotelluric and geomagnetic measurements in auroral and equatorial electrojet regions.",10.1190/1.1441138
Electromagnetic Inversion Using Quasi‐Linear Approximation,"Three‐dimensional electromagnetic inversion continues to be a challenging problem in electrical exploration. We have recently developed a new approach to the solution of this problem based on quasi‐linear approximation of a forward modeling operator. It generates a linear equation with respect to the modified conductivity tensor, which is proportional to the reflectivity tensor and the complex anomalous conductivity. We solved this linear equation by using the regularized conjugate gradient method. After determining a modified conductivity tensor, we used the electrical reflectivity tensor to evaluate the anomalous conductivity. Thus, the developed inversion scheme reduces the original nonlinear inverse problem to a set of linear inverse problems. The developed algorithm has been realized in computer code and tested on synthetic 3-D EM data. The case histories include interpretation of a 3-D magnetotelluric survey conducted in Hokkaido, Japan, and the 3-D inversion of the tensor controlled‐source audio magnetotelluric data over the Sulphur Springs thermal area, Valles Caldera, New Mexico, U.S.A.",10.1190/1.1444839
Remote Sensor Applications To Tectonism And Seismicity In The Northern Part Of The Mississippi Embayment,"A comparative study of Landsat images, SLAR image strips, and Skylab photographs was made to help develop a regional tectonic model and to evaluate the seismic hazards of the northern part of the Mississippi embayment as far south as the Ouachita front. The geomorphic character and distribution of lineaments reflects the structure and tectonics of the area. The fairly consistent trends of northwest‐oriented lineaments suggest the influence of jointing, whereas the variable north‐ and northeast‐trending groups suggest a variety of influences including jointing, faulting, and surficial factors that control stream orientation. A number of northeast‐trending faults are relatively recent, or have significant surface displacements, as they disrupt slopes in equilibrium with drainage. Seismic and aeromagnetic data are available for part of the area. Well‐defined trends of epicenters near New Madrid conform to a pronounced lineament pattern along the Mississippi River. Over a small area near New Madrid, a trend analysis was made of the totals of length‐width ratios of magnetic anomalies grouped in 10-degree intervals. Anomaly trend distributions show some correlation with the azimuth frequency diagrams of lineaments in the embayment. These data suggest basement control along gradients of magnetic anomalies where they parallel mapped lineaments. The tectonic pattern of the area is generally revealed in the landscape, of which the lineaments seem to be a particularly important part. The Mississippi River flows along an axis of active subsidence, possibly actually controlled by tectonic events along the west edge of the embayment, including uplift of the Ozark dome. The tectonic evolution seems to be one of an episodically opening wedge, combining strike‐slip movement along the north and west side of the embayment and step‐faulting down to the east.",10.1190/1.1440725
Results For A Gravity Control Network At Airports In The United States,"Results are presented for a network of gravity control bases located at the major airports throughout the United States. This network of bases was established as a means of integrating existing gravity surveys into a unified whole. It provides not only control of data but also a means of checking and adjusting calibration differences to a common standard. The gravity standard used is that determined by measurements with the Gulf compound quartz pendulum apparatus at a series of sites covering a range of 4,800 mgals between Fairbanks, Alaska, and Mexico City, D. F., Mexico. The accuracy of the individual measurements on an absolute basis is believed to be within 0.3 mgal using a Potsdam datum value of g equal to 980.1190 gals taken at floor level in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey gravity vault in the Commerce Building, Washington, D. C. Observation sites are described with sufficient detail to permit reoccupation within 5 to 6 feet.",10.1190/1.1438499
Dip‐Domain Migration Of Two‐Dimensional Seismic Profiles,"Two‐dimensional migration of seismic time sections by a digital computer has been performed by a variety of techniques, ranging from computer‐simulated hand migration to a computer simulation of elastic wave propagation from the surface receiver positions back into the subsurface. Past processes have utilized the normal moveout equation, whereas the subject process is an application of its spatial derivative. ""Dip‐domain"" migration pertains to special sections where all events have the same space‐time slope, and the migration at each slope is approximated by a trivial function of the subsurface rms velocity and the associated vertical two‐way traveltime. The actual process is to (1) dip decompose a seismic section into so‐called ""dip blocks"" through the applications of appropriate dip‐discriminating coherency functions, (2) migrate the individual dip blocks, and (3) recompose the migrated dip components (dip blocks). The dip‐discriminating coherency functions are computed from a combination of an ""algebraic"" and an ""absolute"" dipping spatial mix of the seismic time section. The input seismic data are not themselves spatially mixed on the dip blocks, but, rather, they are reduced in amplitude by the coherency functions for the dip blocks of which they are not a coherent component. Migration formulas are developed in the Appendix for both spatially invariant and variable subsurface velocity functions. The subject process has some computational advantages. In addition, improved signal‐to‐noise ratios have consistently been obtained due to the dip bandpass (fan) filtering inherent to the process. Synthetic and field seismic examples are included.",10.1190/1.1440829
Estimating Source Location Using Normalized Magnetic Source Strength Calculated From Magnetic Gradient Tensor Data,"For a number of widely used models, normalized source strength (NSS) can be derived from eigenvalues of the magnetic gradient tensor. The NSS is proportional to a constant q normalized by the nth power of the distance between observation and integration points where q is a shape factor depending upon geometry of the model and n is the structural index. The NSS is independent of magnetization direction, and its amplitude is only affected by the magnitude of magnetization. The NSS is also a homogenous function and satisfies Euler's homogeneity equation. Therefore, Euler deconvolution of the NSS can be used to estimate source location. In our algorithm, we use data points enclosed by a square window centered at maxima of the NSS for simultaneously estimating the source location and structural index. The window size is increased until it exceeds a predefined limit. Then the most reliable solution is chosen based on some statistical analysis (minimum uncertainty). One of the advantages of the presented method is that it allows automatic identification of the structural index as the constant background field is eliminated. Another advantage is reduction of interference effects from neighboring sources by differentiation of the NSS. We have compared our method with the analytic signal amplitude and when the magnetic source contains remanent magnetization with a different direction to the inducing field, the NSS provides more reliable information about source geometry. Application of the method has been demonstrated on an aeromagnetic data set from the Tuckers Igneous Complex, Queensland, Australia. The NSS has improved interpretation of magnetic anomalies for this igneous complex, for which available geologic information shows relatively strong remanent magnetization.",10.1190/geo2011-0437.1
Effects Of Surface Scattering In Full-Waveform Inversion,"In full-waveform inversion of seismic body waves, often the free surface is ignored on grounds of computational efficiency. A synthetic study was performed to investigate the effects of this simplification. In terms of size and frequency, the test model and data conform to a real long-offset survey of the upper crust across the San Andreas fault. Random fractal variations are superimposed on a background model with strong lateral and vertical velocity variations ranging from 1200 to 6800 m/s. Synthetic data were computed and inverted for this model and different topographies. A fully viscoelastic time-domain code was used to synthesize the seismograms, and a viscoacoustic frequency-domain code was utilized to invert them. The inversion was focused on early arrivals, which are dominated by P-waves but also contain strong P-Rayleigh wave conversions from the near-field of the receiver. Resulting waveform models show artifacts and a loss of resolution from neglecting the free surface in the inversion, but the inversions are stable, and they still improve the resolution of kinematic models. The extent of deterioration depends more on the subsurface than on the surface structure. Inversion results were improved at no additional expense by introducing a weak contrast along a staircase function above shots and receivers.",10.1190/1.3223315
"Multichannel, Full Waveform And Flexible Electrode Combination Resistivity-Imaging System","The development of a new multichannel and multielectrode, full waveform resistivity acquisition system is presented. This system, which can be built in any electronics workshop without major difficulties, allows for large data collection capacity and flexibility but without the sacrifice of channels, as in most other systems that use a preselected array. A superior interpretation quality is enabled by the increased data and the monitoring of noise through full waveform display. The proposed hardware is robust because no electronics need to be installed in the cable. Therefore, it is suitable for 2D or 3D surface or crosshole tomography. A major feature of the data collection strategy is to capture all of the electrode combinations subject to having one current electrode in each cable. This is efficient because there is no extra cost in doing this. It is an automatic process; one does not have to make any prior decisions as to what electrode combinations to use. The data sets collected with this strategy are suitable for an inversion process involving a large amount of data because the number of voltage values measured using a couple of current electrodes is maximized. Synthetic modeling shows that the proposed approach allows for better imaging of the subsurface than with conventional arrays and the results are comparable to results obtained with an optimized experimental design strategy. A field experiment illustrates the effectiveness of the presented strategy. The inverted image of the subsurface is well-correlated with the available borehole information.",10.1190/1.2435081
Seismic Recorder For Monitoring Magnetic Tape,"A new recorder utilizing Polaroid ""picture‐in‐a‐minute"" film has been developed to monitor seismic data recorded on magnetic tape. Signals from 12 magnetic recording heads are applied through appropriate networks to conventional galvanometers in the monitor as the magnetic record is made. The optical system is arranged to make a miniature seismogram of conventional appearance on a standard 3×4 inch Polaroid print. The record is a satisfactory guide for the operator to evaluate the quality of the record on the magnetic tape without the need for playing it back.",10.1190/1.1438161
The Point Of P-S Mode‐Converted Reflection: An Exact Determination,"The accurate placement of a P-S mode‐converted reflection point on a horizontal reflector is important in stacking surface seismic data for enhancement (Dohr and Janle, 1980; Garotta et al., 1985) and in interpreting results from Zoeppritz's or Knott's equations (Tooley et al., 1965; Young and Braile, 1976). This note describes an adaptation of Snell's law to determine exactly the reflection point of a P-S mode‐converted reflection.",10.1190/1.1442734
Geophysical Methods Adapted To Highway Engineering Problems,"Of the several geophysical methods used in exploration for oil and useful ore bodies, the earth‐resistivity and seismic‐refraction tests have been found to be the most adaptable to the shallow tests generally required in highway construction work. Of these, the earth‐resistivity test is the faster and has a wider range of application to highway problems than does the seismic test. Use of both methods of tests in subsurface explorations for engineering structures is expanding. The paper cites a growing need for a more thorough subsurface investigation of all engineering structure sites and gives examples of field data obtained by the Bureau of Public Roads when making preliminary geophysical surveys of proposed highway locations or structure sites. The economic aspects and the advantages and limitations of the two methods of test are discussed with particular reference to their application to highway engineering problems.",10.1190/1.1437779
Recent Advances In Seismic Lithologic Analysis,"An objective of seismic analysis is to quantitatively extract lithology, porosity, and pore fluid content directly from seismic data. Rock physics provides the fundamental basis for seismic lithology determination. Beyond conventional poststack inversion, the most important seismic lithologic analysis tool is amplitude‐variation‐with‐offset (AVO) analysis. In this paper, I review recent progress in these two key aspects of seismic lithologic analysis.",10.1190/1.1444918
Determining The Orientation Of Marine Csem Receivers Using Orthogonal Procrustes Rotation Analysis,"Electromagnetic receivers deployed to the seafloor for CSEM surveys can have unknown orientations because of the unavailability of compass and tilt recordings. In such situations, only the orientation-independent parameters derived from the measured CSEM field vector can be interpreted, and this may result in less structural resolution than possible when the sensor orientations are known. An orthogonal Procrustes rotation analysis (OPRA) technique can be used to estimate the full 3D receiver orientation for inline and off-line CSEM receivers. The generality of this method allows it to be easily embedded into nonlinear CSEM inversion routines so that they iteratively search for both the receiver orientation and a seafloor electrical-conductivity model compatible with the data. Synthetic tests using the OPRA method jointly with a 1D inversion demonstrate that it can recover the rotation and tilt angles to about one degree accuracy for 1D data and to within a few degrees for 2D data. Application of this method to real survey data shows good agreement with a previous orientation method that is suitable only for determining the horizontal rotation of inline receivers. CSEM data collected over the Pluto gas field offshore the northwest coast of Australia were used to demonstrate how the OPRA method can be used to orient CSEM receivers prior to inversion of only the inline electric- and crossline magnetic-field components.",10.1190/1.3378765
"Marchenko Imaging: Imaging With Primaries, Internal Multiples, And Free-Surface Multiples","Recent work on retrieving the Green's function with the Marchenko equation shows how these functions for a virtual source in the subsurface can be obtained from reflection data. The response to the virtual source is the Green's function from the location of the virtual source to the surface. The Green's function is retrieved using only the reflection response of the medium and an estimate of the first arrival at the surface from the virtual source. Current techniques, however, only include primaries and internal multiples. Therefore, all surface-related multiples must be removed from the reflection response prior to Green's function retrieval. We have extended the Marchenko equation to retrieve the Green's function that includes primaries, internal multiples, and free-surface multiples. In other words, we have retrieved the Green's function in the presence of a free surface. The information needed for the retrieval is the same as the current techniques, with the only difference being that the reflection response now also includes free-surface multiples. The inclusion of these multiples makes it possible to include them in the imaging operator, and it obviates the need for surface-related multiple elimination. This type of imaging with Green's functions is called Marchenko imaging.",10.1190/geo2014-0494.1
"Geophysical Data On The Climax Stock, Nevada Test Site, Nye County, Nevada","A granitic stock at Oak Spring, Nevada, was selected in 1960 by the Atomic Energy Commission as a possible site to study the seismic effect of a deep nuclear shot contained in a large volume of rock. Geophysical surveys were conducted to determine the general configuration of the stock, particularly the thickness. The stock intrudes a sequence of carbonate and siliceous sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic age, which are overlain by Tertiary pyroclastic rocks consisting of tuff, welded tuff, and breccia. A three‐dimensional analysis of a detailed aeromagnetic survey indicates that the stock has a shape similar to a truncated cone, the diameter of which increases from about one mile at the surface to at least 6 miles near sea level, 5,000 feet beneath the surface. The stock, therefore, is much larger than indicated by the area of 113 square miles exposed at the surface. In addition, computations show that the intrusion has a thickness of at least 13,000 ft. Much of the ambiguity of interpretation was removed from the analysis because susceptibility measurements of cores from recent drilling and remanent magnetization data from surface samples were available. Interpretation of a gravity profile over the stock gives the probable thickness of the overlying alluvial fill and buried tuff, but does not delineate the intrusive from the Paleozoic rocks.",10.1190/1.1439067
Energy Distribution In Wavelets And Implications On Resolving Power,"The suite of a wavelet is defined as being all wavelets that share a common amplitude spectrum and total energy but differ in phase spectra. Within a suite there are also classes of wavelets. A wavelet class has a common amplitude envelope and energy distribution. As such, it includes all wavelets that differ by only a constant‐angle phase shift. Of all wavelets within suite, the zero‐phase wavelet has the minimum energy envelope width; its energy is confined to minimum time dispersion. Therefore, the zero‐phase wavelet has maximum resolving power within the suite. Because a zero‐phase wavelet shares its amplitude envelope with a class of wavelets that differ by only a constant phase shift, all wavelets of the class also have maximum resolving power within the suite. The most familiar of these is the quadrature‐phase wavelet (90‐degree phase shift). Use of the complex trace results in an evaluation of the total energy, both potential and kinetic, of the wavelet signal. Assuming the wavelet signal is the output of a velocity geophone, partial energy represents only kinetic energy. Total energy better represents wavelet energy propagating through the earth. Use of partial energy (real signal only) applies a bias that favors the zero‐phase wavelets with respect to others of its class despite identical energy distribution. This bias is corrected when the wavelet envelope is used in the evaluation rather than wavelet trace amplitude. On a wiggle‐trace seismic section (amplitude display) a zero‐phase wavelet maintains a detectability advantage in the presence of noise because of a slightly greater amplitude; however, the advantage is lost in complex trace sections (energy displays) because both reflection strength and instantaneous frequency are independent of a constant phase shift in the wavelet. These sections are identical whether the wavelet is zero‐phase, quadrature‐phase or any other constant phase value, i.e., a wavelet within the zero‐phase class. (This does not imply that reflection strength sections should replace wiggle trace ones, only that they have advantages in the solution of some problems.)",10.1190/1.1443350
Field Testing Of Explosive Surface Seismic Sources In The Canadian Thrust Belt,"Field tests of explosive surface seismic sources conducted in the foothills of Alberta illustrate that data quality obtained from surface shooting can be improved significantly by source‐array design and the placement of detonation points within the array. A source‐array design which maximizes the data quality in the Alberta foothills is a simple, 50 kg, cross‐configuration of linear surface explosives with detonation from all ends. No significant difference occurs between shooting at the ground surface versus elevating and detonating the cross‐configuration a few meters off the ground. Ove‐rshooting can occur by improper design of weighted cross‐configuration arrays. Multifold profiling with the cross‐configuration illustrates that quality seismic data can be derived in the Alberta thrust belt through the use of surface seismic sources.",10.1190/1.1441836
"Seismic Signature Of A Swan Hills (Frasnian) Reef Reservoir, Snipe Lake, Alberta","Swan Hills formation (Frasnian stage) carbonate buildups of the Beaverhill Lake group are generally of low relief and considerable areal extent and are overlain by and encased within the relatively high‐velocity shale of the Waterways formation, which thins but does not drape across the reefs. Consistent with this picture, prereef seismic events are not significantly pulled up beneath the reefs nor are postreef events draped across them. Indeed, the seismic images of these reefs are effectively masked by the high‐amplitude reflections from the overlying top of the Beaverhill Lake group and underlying Gilwood member and cannot be distinguished from those of the basin fill. However, it is possible to identify the reefs indirectly on conventionally processed seismic sections because the image of the encompassing Beaverhill Lake/Gilwood interval varies significantly from onreef to offreef positions. One such Swan Hills formation field at Snipe Lake has an areal extent of about 90km2 and typical reef relief of some 50 m above the platform facies. This reef is shown to be recognizable on three example seismic lines from interference phenomena that vary laterally in association with the lateral variations in thickness of the Swan Hills formation. These phenomena include an offreef peak that is one half‐cycle below the Beaverhill Lake reflection trough and that dies out laterally going onreef, a tendency for the amplitude of the Gilwood event to decrease beneath the reef, and thinning of the order of 5 ms of the onreef section relative to the offreef section. Through seismic modeling, these seismic‐image characteristics are seen to be predictable geophysical manifestations of the inherent geologic variations.",10.1190/1.1442639
An Analysis Of Statistical Average Velocities In A Horizontally Layered Earth,"For a medium consisting of two lithologic components, we analyze relationships among various velocity statistics that have appeared in the literature.

The Prediction Of Porosity In The Permian (Zechstein 2) Carbonate Of Eastern Netherlands Using Seismic Data,"The depositional model of the Zechstein 2 carbonate section is of such a complex nature that it is not possible to predict high‐porosity zones solely from geologic data. We describe a two‐phase study into determination and prediction of porosities in the Zechstein 2 carbonate in the eastern Netherlands. Phase 1 was the basic feasibility study and consisted of two parts, namely, a model study followed by a well‐log study. In both parts, acoustic impedance logs were filtered to test the feasibility of resolving porosity changes within the frequency range of seismic data. Based on our comprehensive model of the environment of deposition of the Zechstein evaporites, a number of acoustic impedance logs were constructed, each log representing a particular environment. These logs then were filtered with a suite of band‐pass filters. It was our observation that the gross changes in porosity were easily recognized. The model study was followed by a study of acoustic impedance logs from actual downhole measurements taken over intervals with depositional environments similar to those represented in the model study. In spite of geologic variations, the changes in porosity were easily observable. Phase 2 involved the prediction and verification of porosity. An exploration well, planned to penetrate the Zechstein 2 carbonate, was connected to a previously drilled carbonate test by a good quality seismic section. In the previous well, porous limestone approximately 60 m in thickness was penetrated. From the combined well and seismic data, we predicted that a similar development of porosity could be expected in the new location. Subsequent drilling proved the presence of porous carbonate approximately 50 m in thickness developed in an environment of deposition similar to that encountered in the other well. This technique has allowed us to predict reservoir porosity and will be used to develop new structural/stratigraphic prospects.",10.1190/1.1441021

"Velocity Model Building By 3D Frequency-Domain, Full-Waveform Inversion Of Wide-Aperture Seismic Data","We assessed 3D frequency-domain (FD) acoustic full-waveform inversion (FWI) data as a tool to develop high-resolution velocity models from low-frequency global-offset data. The inverse problem was posed as a classic least-squares optimization problem solved with a steepest-descent method. Inversion was applied to a few discrete frequencies, allowing management of a limited subset of the 3D data volume. The forward problem was solved with a finite-difference frequency-domain method based on a massively parallel direct solver, allowing efficient multiple-shot simulations. The inversion code was fully parallelized for distributed-memory platforms, taking advantage of a domain decomposition of the modeled wavefields performed by the direct solver. After validation on simple synthetic tests, FWI was applied to two targets (channel and thrust system) of the 3D SEG/EAGE overthrust model, corresponding to 3D domains of   7×8.75×2.25 km   and   13.5×13.5×4.65 km  , respectively. The maximum inverted frequencies are 15 and   7 Hz   for the two applications. A maximum of 30 dual-core biprocessor nodes with   8 GB   of shared memory per node were used for the second target. The main structures were imaged successfully at a resolution scale consistent with the inverted frequencies. Our study confirms the feasibility of 3D frequency-domain FWI of global-offset data on large distributed-memory platforms to develop high-resolution velocity models. These high-velocity models may provide accurate macromodels for wave-equation prestack depth migration.",10.1190/1.2957948
Least-Squares Reverse Time Migration Of Marine Data With Frequency-Selection Encoding,"The phase-encoding technique can sometimes increase the efficiency of the least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) by more than one order of magnitude. However, traditional random encoding functions require all the encoded shots to share the same receiver locations, thus limiting the usage to seismic surveys with a fixed spread geometry. We implement a frequency-selection encoding strategy that accommodates data with a marine streamer geometry. The encoding functions are delta functions in the frequency domain, so that all the encoded shots have unique nonoverlapping frequency content, and the receivers can distinguish the wavefield from each shot with a unique frequency band. Because the encoding functions are orthogonal to each other, there will be no crosstalk between different shots during modeling and migration. With the frequency-selection encoding method, the computational efficiency of LSRTM is increased so that its cost is comparable to conventional RTM for the Marmousi2 model and a marine data set recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. With more iterations, the LSRTM image quality is further improved by suppressing migration artifacts, balancing reflector amplitudes, and enhancing the spatial resolution. We conclude that LSRTM with frequency-selection is an efficient migration method that can sometimes produce more focused images than conventional RTM.",10.1190/geo2013-0003.1
A Loss Mechanism For The Pierre Shale,A theoretical study is made of a fairly simple model of an elastic solid in which losses are attributed to both the shear modulus and the bulk modulus. Each of these elastic parameters is represented by a circuit containing two springs and one dashpot. This is a modification of the usual Kelvin solid that has finite stiffness at infinite frequency. The four relaxation times introduced in the model are determined to fit the experimental data presented by McDonal et al. (1958). It is shown that one can obtain a very good representation of their experimental data with the model described above. The wave equation for an elastic solid is given in a canonical form so that one can compare easily the behavior of different models of the elastic parameters.,10.1190/1.1438645
Combined Simulation And Inversion Of Sp And Resistivity Logs For The Estimation Of Connate-Water Resistivity And Archie'S Cementation Exponent,"Knowledge of initial water saturation is necessary to estimate original hydrocarbon in place. A reliable assessment of this petrophysical property is possible when rock-core measurements of Archie's parameters, such as saturation exponent   n   and cementation exponent   m  , are available. In addition, chemical analysis of formation water is necessary to measure connate-water resistivity    Rw   . Such measurements are seldom available in most applications; if they are available, their reliability may be questionable. We describe a new inversion method to estimate    Rw    and Archie's cementation exponent from the combined use of borehole spontaneous-potential (SP) and raw array-induction resistivity measurements acquired in water-bearing depth intervals. Combined inversion of resistivity and SP measurements is performed assuming a piston-like invasion profile. In so doing, the reservoiris divided into petrophysical layers to account for vertical heterogeneities. Inversion products are values of invaded and virgin formation resistivity, radius of invasion, and static spontaneous potential (SSP). Connate-water resistivity is calculated by assuming membrane and diffusion potentials as the main contributors to the SSP. Archie's or dual-water equations enable the estimation of   m  . The new combined estimation method has been successfully applied to a data set acquired in a clastic formation. Data were acquired in a high permeability and moderately high-salt-concentration reservoir. Values of    Rw    and   m   yielded by the inversion are consistent with those obtained with a traditional interpretation method, thereby confirming the reliability of the estimation. The method is an efficient, rigorous alternative to conventional interpretation techniques for performing petrophysical analysis of exploratory and appraisal wells wherein rock-core measurements may not be available.",10.1190/1.2890408
"Interpretation Of Isostatic Anomalies South Of Java, Using Integral Equations And Crustal Deformation Theories",The gravity measurements of Vening Meinesz show the existence of a symmetric belt of negative gravity anomalies south of Java. The mass distribution on a surface 40 kms deep which will explain the observed anomalies is determined by means of an integral equation. This mass distribution is interpreted as resulting from the deformation of a crust normally 40 kms thick. By applying Vening Meinesz's theory to the resulting deformation one concludes that the crust folded as though it had a Young's Modulus of 108dynes/cm2. Some comments are made on Gunn's theory of mountain formation. It is shown that his theory predicts an increase in the compressive forces in the crust of 20dynes/cm2/year in the Paleozoic Era and of 80dynes/cm2/year in the Cenozoic Era. These values are shown to be in fair agreement with those predicted by the thermal contraction theory.,10.1190/1.1437238
Fdtd Simulation Of Em Wave Propagation In 3-D Media,"A finite‐difference, time‐domain solution to Maxwell's equations has been developed for simulating electromagnetic wave propagation in 3-D media. The algorithm allows arbitrary electrical conductivity and permittivity variations within a model. The staggered grid technique of Yee is used to sample the fields. A new optimized second‐order difference scheme is designed to approximate the spatial derivatives. Like the conventional fourth‐order difference scheme, the optimized second‐order scheme needs four discrete values to calculate a single derivative. However, the optimized scheme is accurate over a wider wavenumber range. Compared to the fourth‐order scheme, the optimized scheme imposes stricter limitations on the time step sizes but allows coarser grids. The net effect is that the optimized scheme is more efficient in terms of computation time and memory requirement than the fourth‐order scheme. The temporal derivatives are approximated by second‐order central differences throughout. The Liao transmitting boundary conditions are used to truncate an open problem. A reflection coefficient analysis shows that this transmitting boundary condition works very well. However, it is subject to instability. A method that can be easily implemented is proposed to stabilize the boundary condition. The finite‐difference solution is compared to closed‐form solutions for conducting and nonconducting whole spaces and to an integral‐equation solution for a 3-D body in a homogeneous half‐space. In all cases, the finite‐difference solutions are in good agreement with the other solutions. Finally, the use of the algorithm is demonstrated with a 3-D model. Numerical results show that both the magnetic field response and electric field response can be useful for shallow‐depth and small‐scale investigations.",10.1190/1.1443930
"Dielectric Properties Of Dry, Geologic Materials","A detailed investigation of the dielectric properties of powdered and solid dry rocks in the frequency range of 50 hz to 2 mhz has revealed the following general characteristics: 1) All dry rocks, powdered and solid, show an increase in both the dielectric constant and the loss tangent as frequency decreases and as temperature increases. This dispersion is believed to be due to polarization associated with charge buildup at grain boundaries or at grain imperfections. 2) Dry powdered rocks often show a thermally‐activated relaxation peak with a typical Debye‐relaxation character. This is due to the presence of pyroxene and biotite and may be associated with other minerals. The relaxation peak is not seen in solid rocks, where it is hidden by the low‐frequency dispersion. 3) At high frequencies, the loss tangent approaches a constant value which is frequency independent. This behavior is observed in many dielectrics and may be the result of a distribution of relaxation times.",10.1190/1.1440120
The Migrator'S Equation For Anisotropic Media,"The migrator's equation, which gives the relationship between real and apparent dips on a reflector in zero‐offset reflection seismic sections, may be readily implemented in one step with a frequency‐domain migration algorithm for homogeneous media. Huygens' principle is used to derive a similar relationship for anisotropic media where velocities are directionally dependent. The anisotropic form of the migrator's equation is applicable to both elliptically and nonelliptically anisotropic media. Transversely isotropic media are used to demonstrate the performance of an f-k implementation of the migrator's equation for anisotropic media. In such a medium SH-waves are elliptically anisotropic, while P-waves are nonelliptically anisotropic. Numerical model data and physical model data demonstrate the performance of the algorithm, in each case recovering the original structure. Isotropic and anisotropic migration of anisotropic physical model data are compared experimentally, where the anisotropic velocity function of the medium has a vertical axis of symmetry. Only when anisotropic migration is used is the original structure recovered.",10.1190/1.1442789
Analysis And Prediction Of Geophone Performance Parameters,"In the past, designers relied greatly on simplified geophone models to describe the physical quantities of a geophone. Several iterations of fine tuning the geophone variables were required to achieve a desired geophone characteristic. Although many geophone prototypes were built before a geophone design was finalized, it was still impossible to assure an optimum geophone design. An easier, faster, and more accurate method of predicting geophone parameters is described and the method of computer‐aided geophone design is outlined. A description of a nonlinear geophone model is presented and a numerical method to compute the nonlinear magnetic flux density distribution is outlined. An integration algorithm is used to compute the geophone sensitivity and open‐circuit damping. The measurement of geophone distortion is described, and the harmonic distortion due to nonlinearity of sensitivity and damping is computed. The data of a geophone spring constant were obtained through a recent experiment, and the harmonic distortions caused by the nonlinearity of the spring are computed. Finally, the total harmonic distortion of a geophone is obtained. Programs developed to predict geophone sensitivity, damping, and distortion are described. It is shown that the method used to compute the nonlinear flux density distribution converges properly and the results obtained are meaningful. Three different types of geophones are analyzed and a comparison between the simulated and measured data is made. In all three cases, good correlation exists between the parameters predicted and the parameters actually measured. Information obtained by geophone parameter prediction can be very useful in the geophone design process, in optimizing geophones, and in achieving higher performance levels.",10.1190/1.1441994
Inverse Scattering Of Surface Waves: A New Look At Surface Consistency ,"A method is presented for eliminating near‐surface scattered noise from seismic data. Starting from an appropriately chosen background model, a surface‐consistent scattering model is determined using linearized elastodynamic inverse scattering theory. This scattering model does not necessarily equal the actual scatterer distribution, but it enables one to calculate, approximately, the near‐surface scattered part of the data. The method honors at least some of the complexity of the near‐surface scattering process and can be applied in cases where traditional methods, like wavenumber‐frequency filtering techniques and methods for static corrections, are ineffective. From a number of tests on synthetic data, we conclude that the method is rather robust; its main sensitivity is because of errors in the determination of the background Rayleigh‐wave velocity.",10.1190/1.1443656

Computer Systems For Real‐Time Marine Exploration,"The goals of the Gulfrex are to perform marine exploration and to conduct research and development in the various facets of marine exploration. The Gulfrex is equipped with various geologic and geophysical data‐gathering instruments along with a highly sophisticated navigational package. Computerized control systems were designed to output data in real time so that preliminary interpretations could be made concurrently with data collection. One system, based on an EMR‐6130 computer, handles multichannel seismic data. This system includes routines for real‐time demultiplexing, normal moveout, stacking, and deconvolution. Output of demultiplexed data is to magnetic tape and optionally to paper records. Output of moveout‐corrected, stacked data is to a visual monitor and to magnetic tape via a PDP‐8 computer. Deconvolution may be applied to either the single‐channel traces or the stacked traces. A moveout‐corrected, CDP group is output to a paper record every 24 shots so that estimates of average velocities can be made for a normal‐moveout correction. Another system, designed for a PDP‐8 computer, is used to collect data from devices interfaced to it. These include single‐channel seismic data, gravity and magnetic measurements, and navigational measurements such as course, speed, ship position, and direction. Deconvolved single‐channel seismic data are plotted in real time on a visual monitor along with a corrected gravity profile, magnetic profile, speed, course, and time of day. A map of the ship's course is plotted in real time on a drum plotter Inquiries may be made of the system for current position in latitude and longitude.",10.1190/1.1440341
On The Phase Constraint Of The Magnetotelluric Impedance,A simple proof that the phase of the one‐ dimensional magnetotelluric modified impedance lies between −π/4 and π/4 is given. The proof is based upon a rational polynomial representation of the impedance. The formalism from which the rational representation is obtained is outlined. An adjoint model is defined and it is shown to be pertinent for the proof. A numerical example is given.,10.1190/1.1440528
The Influence Of Pore Pressure And Confining Pressure On Dynamic Elastic Properties Of Berea Sandstone,"Compressional‐ and shear‐wave velocities of watersaturated Berea sandstone have been measured as functions of confining and pore pressures to 2 kbar. The velocities, measured by the pulse transmission technique, were obtained at selected pressures for the purpose of evaluating the relative importance of confining pressure and pore pressure on elastic wave velocities and derived dynamic elastic constants. Changes in Berea sandstone velocities resulting from changes in confining pressure are not exactly canceled by equivalent changes in pore pressure. For properties that involve significant bulk compression (compressional‐wave velocities and bulk modulus) an incremental change in pore pressure does not entirely cancel a similar change in confining pressure. On the other hand, it is shown that a pore pressure increment more than cancels an equivalent change in confining pressure for properties that depend significantly on rigidity (shear‐wave velocity and Poisson's ratio). This behavior (as well as observed wave amplitudes) is related to the presence of high‐compressibility clay that lines grains and pores within the quartz framework of the Berea sandstone.",10.1190/1.1441910
Standardization In Gravity Reduction,"Gravity reduction standards are needed to improve anomaly quality for interpretation and to facilitate the joining together of different data sets. To the extent possible, data reduction should be quantitative, objective, and comprehensive, leaving ambiguity only to the interpretation process that involves qualitative, subjective, and geological decisions. The term (Bouguer anomaly) describes a field intended to be free of all nongeologic effects—not modified by a partial geologic interpretation. Measured vertical gradients of gravity demonstrate considerable variation but do not suggest, as often reported, that the normal free‐air gradient is in error or needs to be locally adjusted. Such gradients are strongly influenced by terrain and, to a lesser extent, by the same geologic sources which produce Bouguer anomalies. A substantial body of existing literature facilitates the comprehensive treatment of terrain effects, which may be rigorously implemented with current computer technology. Although variations in topographic rock density are a major source of Bouguer anomalies, a constant density appropriate to the area under investigation is normally adopted as a data reduction standard, leaving a treatment of the density variations to the interpretation. A field example from British Columbia illustrates both the variations in vertical gravity gradients which can be encountered and the conclusion that the classical approach to data reduction is practically always suitable to account for the observed effects. Standard data reduction procedures do not (and should not) include reduction‐to‐datum. The interpreter must be aware, however, that otherwise ""smooth"" regional Bouguer anomalies caused by regional sources do contain high‐frequency components in areas of rugged topography.",10.1190/1.1443137
A High‐Frequency Sparker Source For The Borehole Environment,"For tomographic investigations of shallow subsurface features of limited lateral extent, a high‐frequency, low‐cost borehole seismic source would be highly desirable, particularly for investigators with limited budgets. We constructed a simple, arc‐discharge seismic source from off‐the‐shelf items. This source consists of a salt water filled bottle containing exposed conductors of a coaxial cable, across which 100 to 300 joules of electrical power were discharged. This source produced a seismic pulse with a dominant frequency in the neighborhood of 1.5 kHz and a half‐power bandwidth in excess of 1 kHz. Repeatability of seismic signatures in a variety of environmental settings was excellent. Sufficient power was generated to observe seismic signals with at least a 35 dB signal‐to‐noise ratio at horizontal borehole separations of 100 m. For a borehole separation of 33.2 m, signals with at least a 35 dB signal‐to‐noise ratio were observed at angular ranges in the vertical plane to 68 degrees. The hydrostatic head limit for this source was determined to be approximately 430 m.",10.1190/1.1443450
The Effect Of Stress Rate And Temperature On The Strength Of Basalt And Granite,"The ultimate strengths of basalt and granite were measured over a range of stress rates from 2×10 to 3×1010 psi per second. A comparison of basalt and granite showed that, although their static strengths were close, their dynamic strengths were different. The static strengths of basalt and granite were 27.5 and 29 kpsi, respectively, at the stress rate of 2×10 psi per second while their strengths at the stress rate of 3×1010 psi per second were 59 and 70 kpsi, respectively. In order to obtain an insight into the basic mechanisms of rock fracturing, the combined effects of stress rate and temperature were studied. The strength of basalt was increased from 27.5 kpsi at room temperature to 45 kpsi at liquid nitrogen temperature at the stress rate of 2×10 psi per second. The mechanisms of fracturing were thermally activated. The activation energy for basalt at 50 kpsi equalled 450 calories per mole. The dynamic modulus of basalt measured by the pulse technique was 1.7×107 psi. The value of the dynamic modulus obtained at a stress rate of 3×108 psi per second was 2.2×107 psi.",10.1190/1.1439947
Automatic Gravity Optimization Of 2.5D Strike Listric Fault Sources With Analytically Defined Fault Planes And Depth-Dependent Density,"An automatic gravity inversion technique in the space domain simultaneously estimates the parameters of strike-limited listric fault sources and regional gravity background from a set of observed Bouguer gravity anomalies. The fault profile and regional effect are described by unknown polynomial functions of arbitrary but prescribed degree. Furthermore, the density contrast within the fault structure is presumed to be known, according to a prescribed parameterized nonlinear function of depth, in geologic settings where the detached downthrown block consists of a series of sedimentary beds whose density increases with depth. The inversion is automatic in that it initializes and determines polynomial coefficients for the fault boundary and regional gravity background from a set of observed Bouguer gravity anomalies and improves them iteratively until the modeled gravity anomalies mimic the observed anomalies. An analysis of a set of gravity anomalies attributable to a synthetic model of a listric fault structure in the presence of pseudorandom noise with and without regional background has disclosed that the algorithm yields reliable interpretations with modest error in model geometry, even in the presence of pseudorandom noise. In the presence of regional gravity background and pseudorandom noise, the estimated parameters of the structure deviate marginally from the true ones. The derived density-depth model of the Jharia coal basin in India, a pull-apart basin, has been used to analyze the observed Bouguer gravity anomalies of a boundary fault. The interpretation has yielded information consistent with drilling results and geologic setting of the basin.",10.1190/1.3541957
Gpr Characterization Of A Lacustrine Uxo Site,"We used   135-MHz   ground-penetrating-radar (GPR) reflection profiles to determine if high-explosive (HE) depth bombs were possibly detonated within a small New England lake formerly used as a bombing range, as well as the depths and distribution of inert and possibly unexploded ordnance (UXO) within the subbottom sediments. Maximum water depth was   8.6 m  . The primary munitions were unarmed practice bombs, but terrestrial fragments from HE depth bombs led us to seek stratigraphic obliteration and distortion as evidence of their use. The low water conductivity and quartz-rich sediments provided more than   8 m   of subbottom penetration beneath slope and shelf sediments. The high permittivities of the water and subbottom sediments provided good antenna directivity, excellent 2D migrations, multicentimeter vertical resolution, and a unique pulse waveform signature for metal objects. Our line profiles revealed hundreds of subbottom diffractions, which implied an areal distribution of thou-sands of suspicious objects. Most lay beneath the central basin, but many resided beneath the slopes and shelves as well. Supplementary profiles of a nearby pristine lake and of controlled munitions, a side-scan sonar bottom survey, and time-domain reflectometry dielectric measurements of sediment samples corroborated our findings of natural stratigraphy, a unique metallic diffraction phase signature, the existence of many nonmetallic objects including logs, and subbottom relative permittivities ranging from 28 to 76. The intact natural lacustrine strata, including deltaic foresets and bottom sets, faults, and conformable and unconformable horizons, suggest that live bombs likely did not detonate in the lake. The only stratigraphic disturbances we found were apparent perforations beneath about   1 m   of water, within which diffractions of metallic origin originated. The dielectric results and the prominent slope strata over the deepest horizons led us to conclude that the exceptional subbottom penetration existed under predominantly sandy sediments.",10.1190/1.3467782
Fluid‐Property Discrimination With Avo: A Biot‐Gassmann Perspective,"This analysis draws together basic rock physics, amplitude variations with offset (AVO), and seismic amplitude inversion to discuss how fluid‐factor discrimination can be performed using prestack seismic data. From both Biot and Gassmann theories for porous, fluid‐saturated rocks, a general formula is first derived for fluid‐factor discrimination given that both the P and S impedances are available. In essence, the two impedances are transformed so that they better differentiate between the fluid and rock matrix of the porous medium. This formula provides a more sensitive discriminator of the pore‐fluid saturant than the acoustic impedance and is especially applicable in hard‐rock environments. The formulation can be expressed with either the Lamé constants and density, or the bulk and shear moduli and density. Numerical and well‐log examples illustrate the applicability of this approach. AVO inversion results are then incorporated to show how this method can be implemented using prestack seismic data. Finally, a shallow gas‐sand example from Alberta and a well‐log example from eastern Canada are shown to illustrate the technique.",10.1190/1.1543192
1-D Elastic Waveform Inversion: A Divide‐And‐Conquer Approach,"Subsurface rock properties are manifested in seismic records as variations in traveltimes, amplitudes, and waveforms. It is commonly acknowledged that traveltimes are sensitive to the long wavelength part of the velocity, whereas amplitudes are sensitive to the short wavelength part of the velocity. The inherent sensitivity of seismic velocity at different wavelengths suggests an approach that decomposes the waveform data into traveltime and amplitude components. Therefore we propose a divide‐and‐conquer approach to the elastic waveform inversion problem. We first estimate the smoothly varying background velocity from the traveltime and the rapidly changing perturbations from the amplitude by amplitude variation with offset (AVO) inversion based on linearized reflection coefficient. Then we combine the perturbation with the background to obtain a starting model to be used in the final waveform inversion that models all converted waves and internal multiples assuming a 1-D earth model. For estimating the background velocity, we use the flatness of events as the objective criterion, and simulated annealing as a search tool. Three different model parameterization schemes (constant velocity blocks, splines, and arctangent models) are compared, with the arctangent having the most flexibility and least artifacts. Having obtained the background velocities, we analyze the AVO effects to estimate the perturbations to the background, for which we use a linearized inversion method. The combination of the perturbation and background should be sufficiently close to the true model so that the inverse problem becomes quasi‐linear. A full elastic waveform inversion is used to fine‐tune the combined model to obtain P-wave and S-wave velocity and density, again using either a nonlinear optimization method or an iterative linearized solution. Application of the inversion algorithm to synthetic data from an 84-layer model was able to predict the full reflectivity data and recover the true model parameters. Application to one seismic line in the Carolina Trough area found a thin gas zone which produces strong Bottom Simulating Reflectors (BSRs).",10.1190/1.1444463
Model Seismology—The Critical Refraction Of Elastic Waves,"Model experiments on the head wave are described. Quantitative data are obtained for three different pairs of media: light lubricating oil on top of a saturated solution of calcium chloride, water on top of wax, and water on top of concrete. Within the limits of experimental error these data agree with the theoretical prediction that the head wave should decay with distance as r-1/2L-3/2 (Heelan, 1953).",10.1190/1.1438133
Imaging Permafrost Velocity Structure Using High Resolution 3D Seismic Tomography,"A 3D seismic survey (Mallik 3D), covering 126  km2 in the Mackenzie Delta area of Canada's north, was conducted by industry in 2002. Numerous lakes and marine inundation create a complex near-surface structure in the permafrost terrain. Much of the near subsurface remains frozen but significant melt zones exist particularly from perennially unfrozen water bodies. This results in an irregular distribution of permafrost ice creating a complex pattern of low and high frequency near-surface velocity variations which induce significant traveltime distortions in surface seismic data. A high resolution 3D traveltime tomography study was employed to map the permafrost velocity structure utilizing first-arrival traveltimes picked from 3D seismic shot records. Approximately 900,000 traveltime picks from 3167 shots were used in the inversion. Tomographic inversion of the first-arrival traveltimes resulted in a smooth velocity model for the upper 200 m of the subsurface. Ray coverage in the model is excellent down to 200 m providing effective control for estimating velocities through tomographic inversion. Resolution tests conducted through horizontal and vertical checkerboard tests confirm the robustness of the velocity model in detailing small scale velocity variations. Well velocities were used to validate tomographic velocities. The tomographic velocities do not show systematic correlation with well velocities. The velocity model clearly images the permafrost velocity structure in lateral and vertical directions. It is inferred from the velocity model that the permafrost structure in the near subsurface is discontinuous. Extensions of surface water bodies in depth, characterized by low P-wave velocities, are well imaged by the velocity model. Deep lakes with unfrozen water, inferred from the tomographic velocity model, correlate with areas of strong amplitude blanking and frequency attenuation observed in processed reflection seismic stack sections.",10.1190/geo2010-0353.1

New Fault Attribute Based On Robust Directional Scheme,"We present a steered data-analysis approach to measure coherence for fault detection. In contrast with conventional coherence, which detects discontinuities without distinction, our approach aims to identify faults only. Assuming the local linearity of fault geometry, the method performs a continuity test using a steered data-analysis window over a set of dip/azimuth directions. A robust, selective directional continuity test is achieved by combining measures of coherence computed from a few aligned, steered windows. Finally, fault detection consists of finding the maximum directional response and accumulating it into an attribute volume. A comparison between results obtained on both synthetic and real seismic images indicates the new method is superior to the conventional coherence measure in isolating faults from stratigraphic signature and noise. Undesired scale, staircase, and mislocation effects are reduced noticeably.",10.1190/1.2718605
Computation Charts For Linear Increase Of Velocity With Depth,"Computation charts are presented which reduce or eliminate calculations of correlation and wave‐front depth charts. A series of depth charts are made for particular values of the velocity increment solving the time‐depth relation for all possible initial velocities of the equation y=(Vo/k)(ekt-1). From these charts, the average velocity‐depth curves are obtained, and also the velocity function to be used on a project determined from velocity shooting by comparison to the theoretical average velocity‐depth curves. For wave‐front depth charts, a series of families of curves are plotted for the full range of velocity increments and all initial velocities for the equations of the instantaneous center of the wave front, z=(Vo/k)(coshkt/2-1), and the radius of the wave front, r=(Vo/k)(sinhkt/2). The relation between k and ekt/2 for a range of times is plotted, and therefrom the value of ekt/2 obtained for the particular velocity increment for the solution of the equation tanθ/2=tanθ0/2⋅ekt/2. Finally, curves for a series of tan θ/2 against initial velocity curves are plotted for a series of step out times, and therefrom the value of tanθ/2=tanθ0/2⋅ekt/2, or the angle of dip, θ, is obtained. This latter family of curves can be used to determine the variation of dip with variation in initial velocity in highly folded areas. The latter set of curves is useful for the construction of a time‐step‐out time‐dip‐depth‐offset chart which is used for direct plotting of offset‐depth‐dip positions of reflecting horizons, or as a trace‐analysis underlay chart.",10.1190/1.1437595
Noninterchangeability Of Sources And Receivers In A Heterogeneous Medium,"The starting point in the design of source patterns, seismometer groups, and multifolding parameters is a wave test. A wave test is usually performed with the source at a fixed location and the seismometers planted along a line at increasing distances from the source. If more coverage is desired than that provided by the length of the wave‐test cable, the cable is moved further from the source and source initiation is repeated. A wave test conducted with the source at a fixed location and the receivers planted at locations covering a range of distances from the source is here designated a normal wave test. Sometimes a wave‐test spread is kept fixed and the source is moved throughout a range of distances at intervals equal to the spread length to obtain the desired coverage. This may be termed a ""semitransposed"" wave test. It is sometimes desirable to perform a wave test in which a single receiver is kept at a fixed location and the source points are spaced at appropriately small intervals. This type of wave test is designated as a transposed wave test in this report. Principal interfering waves frequently can be identified by the use of a transposed wave test in certain areas where normal wave‐test sections indicate a confused mixture of waves having apparent velocities both toward and away from the source point. Comparison of transposed and normal wave‐test seismograms taken in such areas shows that source‐receiver interchangeability does not hold for the heterogeneous medium.",10.1190/1.1440414
"Fluid Salinity, Clay Content, And Permeability Of Rocks Determined Through Complex Resistivity Partition Fraction Decomposition","The types of physical mechanisms that generate induced electric polarization (IP) in rocks are here identified and their respective relaxation times are provided. Thus, the complex resistivity function associated with Dias' model that describes the IP phenomenon is decomposed into partition fractions of an inverse third-degree polynomial in (iω)1/2. Twelve rock samples' data from the literature were used for this investigation. Using this procedure, two basic relaxations appear in the frequency range 1 mHz–1 MHz, where the phenomenon occurs. The first relaxation is associated with polarization caused by ionic diffusion proximal to the disseminated particle-electrolytic solution interfaces, which dominates in the low-frequency interval (approximately 1 mHz–100 Hz). The second process is capacitive-inductive polarization relaxation caused by an interaction between the electric double-layer capacitance and polarization-free pore resistances inside the polarization unit cell, which dominates in the high-frequency interval (approximately 10 kHz–1 MHz). At intermediate frequencies, these two processes combine to yield a transitional type of relaxation that dominates in the intermediate frequency interval (approximately 100 Hz–10 kHz). Our results, obtained using a given set of experimental data, provide a new method for determining the water salinity and clay content in the rock matrix without metallic particles. The rock permeability was also well determined by introducing Dias' model parameter relationships and substituting the double-layer thickness for the grain size radius in a previously proposed formula.",10.1190/geo2013-0306.1
Simplified Anisotropy Parameters For Transversely Isotropic Sedimentary Rocks,"Sedimentary rocks frequently possess an anisotropic structure resulting, for example, from fine scale layering, the presence of oriented microcracks or fractures, or the preferred orientation of nonspherical grains or anisotropic minerals. For many rocks the anisotropy may be described, to a good approximation, as being transversely isotropic. The purpose of this note is to present simplified anisotropy parameters for these rocks that are valid when the P‐wave normal moveout (NMO) and vertical velocities differ by less than 25%. This condition appears reasonable since depths calculated from P‐wave stacking velocities are often within 10% of actual depths (Winterstein, 1986). It is found that when this condition is satisfied the elastic constants c13 and c44 affect the P‐wave NMO velocity and anellipticity only through the combination c13+2c44, a combination of elastic constants that can be determined using walkaway VSP data (Miller et al., 1993). The anellipticity quantifies the deviation of the P‐phase slowness from an ellipse and also determines the difference between the vertical and NMO velocities for SV‐waves. Helbig (1983) has shown that a time‐migrated section for which elliptical anisotropy has been taken into account is identical to one that has been determined under the assumption of isotropy. The anellipticity is therefore the important anisotropy parameter for anisotropic time migration. The results given are of interest for anisotropic velocity analysis, time migration, and time‐to‐depth conversion.",10.1190/1.1443925
"Quantitative Interpretation For Gas Hydrate Accumulation In The Eastern Green Canyon Area, Gulf Of Mexico Using Seismic Inversion And Rock Physics Transform","Gas hydrate can be interpreted from seismic data through observation of bottom simulating reflector (BSR). It is a challenge to interpret gas hydrate without BSR. Three-dimensional qualitative and quantitative seismic interpretations were used to characterize gas hydrate distribution and concentration in the eastern Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico, where BSR is absent. The combination of qualitative and quantitative interpretation reduces ambiguities in the estimation and identification of gas hydrate. Sandy deposition and faults are qualitatively interpreted from amplitude data. The 3D acoustic impedance volume was interpreted in terms of high P-impedance hydrate zones and low P-impedance free gas zones. Gas hydrate saturation derived from P-impedance is estimated by a rock physics transform. We interpreted gas hydrate in the sand-prone sediments with a maximum saturation of approximately 50% of the pore space. Sheet-like and some bright spot gas hydrate accumulations are interpreted. The interpretation of sheet-like gas hydrate within sand-prone sediments around faults suggests that fluid moves into the sand zones laterally by conduits. Variations in depths of interpreted gas hydrate zones imply nonequilibrium conditions. Low P-impedance free gas zones within high P-impedance gas hydrate zones imply possible coexistence of hydrate and free gas within the hydrate stability zone. We propose that gas hydrate distribution and concentration are associated with structures, buried sedimentary bodies, sources of gas, and fluid flux.",10.1190/1.3581358
An Analytic Model For The Stress-Induced Anisotropy Of Dry Rocks,"One of the main causes of azimuthal anisotropy in sedimentary rocks is anisotropy of tectonic stresses in the earth's crust. We have developed an analytic model for seismic anisotropy caused by the application of a small anisotropic stress. We first considered an isotropic linearly elastic medium (porous or nonporous) permeated by a distribution of discontinuities with random (isotropic) orientation (such as randomly oriented compliant grain contacts or cracks). The geometry of individual discontinuities is not specified. Instead, their behavior is defined by a ratio B of the normal to tangential excess compliances. When this isotropic rock is subjected to a small compressive stress (isotropic or anisotropic), the number of cracks along a particular plane is reduced in proportion to the normal stress traction acting on that plane. This effect is modeled using the Sayers-Kachanov noninteractive approximation. The model predicts that such anisotropic crack closure yields elliptical anisotropy, regardless of the value of the compliance ratio B. It also predicts the ratio of Thomsen's anisotropy parameters   ɛ/γ   as a function of the compliance ratio B and Poisson's ratio of the unstressed rock. A comparison of the model predictions with the results of laboratory measurements indicates a reasonable agreement for moderate magnitudes of uniaxial stress (as high as 30 MPa). These results can be used for differentiating stress-induced anisotropy from that caused by aligned fractures. Conversely, if the cause of anisotropy is known, then the anisotropy pattern allows one to estimate P-wave anisotropy from S-wave anisotropy.",10.1190/1.3567950
"Search For Geothermal Seismic Noise In The East Mesa Area, Imperial Valley, California","A seismic noise experiment was conducted in the East Mesa area of Imperial Valley, California, by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in May 1972. There is a pronounced heat flow anomaly over the area, and between July 1972 and the present five deep test wells have been drilled over the anomaly by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 1974). At the time of our survey, we were aware of results from a preliminary seismic noise survey in East Mesa by Teledyne Geotech (Douze and Sorrells, 1972). A detailed noise survey was conducted by Teledyne Geotech soon after our experiment (Geothermal Staff of Teledyne Geotech, 1972). Both the Teledyne Geotech surveys show noise levels (in the 3.0 to 5.0 hz band) 12–18 db higher over the area where the thermal gradients and heat flow reach maximum values than in the surroundings. Our results, on the other hand, show that the seismic noise field in the area is dominated by cultural noise, and it is impossible to see a noise anomaly that can be related to the geothermal phenomena in East Mesa. We think that it is important to take into account this disagreement between the two results in order to make a critical evaluation of the utility of seismic noise as a geothermal prospecting tool. The purpose of this note is to put our findings on record.",10.1190/1.1440583
Phase Encoding Of Shot Records In Prestack Migration,"Frequency‐domain shot‐record migration can produce higher quality images than Kirchhoff migration but typically at a greater cost. The computing cost of shot‐record migration is the product of the number of shots in the survey and the expense of each individual migration. Many attempts to reduce this cost have focused on the speed of the individual migrations, trying to achieve a better trade‐off between accuracy and speed. Another approach is to reduce the number of migrations. We investigate the simultaneous migration of shot records using frequency‐domain shot‐record migration algorithms. The difficulty with this approach is the production of so‐called crossterms between unrelated shot and receiver wavefields, which generate unwanted artifacts or noise in the final image. To reduce these artifacts and obtain an image comparable in quality to the single‐shot‐per‐migration result, we have introduced a process called phase encoding, which shifts or disperses these crossterms. The process of phase encoding thus allows one to trade S/N ratio for the speed of migrating the entire survey. Several encoding functions and two application strategies have been tested. The first strategy, combining multiple shots per migration and using each shot only once, reduces computation in direct relation to the number of shots combined. The second strategy, performing multiple migrations of all the shots in the survey, provides a means to reduce the crossterm noise by stacking the resulting images. The additional noise in both strategies may be tolerated if it is no stronger than the inherent seismic noise in the migrated image and if the final image is achieved with less cost.",10.1190/1.1444737
Ghost Elimination From Reflection Records,A method is described for the elimination of ghost energy from reflection records. Two or more shots at different depths are recorded on magnetic tapes. The magnetic tapes are then composited in groups of two or more. The formula is derived for the calculations of shot depth separation and the relative displacements of the magnetic tapes on replay. The application of the method to an everyday field technique is illustrated with examples.,10.1190/1.1438977
Seismic Mapping Of Underground Cavities Using Reflection Amplitudes,"Underground cavities (and similar marked lateral changes in seismic impedance) having dimensions of tens to hundreds of meters should markedly reflect artificial seismic waves and locally obstruct reflections from deeper horizons. This should be especially true for liquid‐filled cavities if shear waves are employed. Attempts have been made to apply these principles in delineating solution‐mined cavities in bedded salt. In one seismically reverberant area, results from a brine‐filled cavity 300 m below the surface were unclear. Strong seismic ""shadows"" were found, however, in a seismic reflection survey of solution cavities 500 m below the surface, in a seismically favorable area. At present, the method requires good reflecting horizons both above and below the stratum to be explored. The amplitude ratio of the two reflections is used to represent the seismic ""opacity"" of the stratum between, normalized for the effect of varying seismic efficiencies at the shots and detectors. Among other applications, the method should be useful in mapping natural caverns and nuclear‐blast cavities.",10.1190/1.1439618
Relative Resolving Power Of Four‐Point Resistivity Configurations,"The ease of interpretation of four‐point resistivity measurements depends on the ratio of power electrode spread to probe spacing. Reduction of the probe spacing improves the resolubility of the resistivity graphs. It also reduces the error of the linear approximations. Field conditions, such as measuring sensitivity and maximum impressed ground voltage, limit the spacing ratio in practice. A two‐layer system has been investigated. The trend of the resistivity profiles at various spacing ratios and their evaluation capabilities are discussed.",10.1190/1.1439196

Prism Waves In Seafloor Canyons And Their Effects On Seismic Imaging,"Complex seafloor bathymetry can create significant challenges for subsurface imaging and geologic interpretation of seismic exploration and monitoring data. Steep seafloor canyons that cut through continental shelf areas can produce very strong seismic wavefield distortions. Neglecting such wavefield complexity can result in inaccurate velocity models, significant imaging errors, misleading amplitudes, and erroneous geologic interpretations. We have evaluated the kinematic and dynamic effects of seismic prism waves generated by seafloor canyons. Prism waves are seismic waves that undergo consecutive reflections at a scattering interface before propagating to the recording sensor array. We have demonstrated that strong prism waves can be generated for realistic seafloor canyon geometries, and we determined how their adverse effects can contaminate seismic imaging and velocity estimation.",10.1190/geo2015-0014.1
Borehole Field Calibration And Measurement Of Low‐Concentration Manganese By Decay Gamma Rays,"The manganese concentration in the Arundel clay formation, Prince Georges County, Maryland, was determined from a borehole by using delayed neutron activation. The neutrons were produced by a 100μg252Cf source. The 847 keV gamma ray of manganese was detected continuously, and its counting rate was measured at intervals of 15 s as the measuring sonde was moved at a rate of 0.5 cm/s. The technique measured the concentration ratio of manganese to aluminum. This ratio, when combined with an estimate of the aluminum concentration of the clay, made it possible to determine the percentage concentration of manganese without using a test‐pit calibration facility. The measurements were made by using an NaI(Tl) scintillation detector and a Ge(HP) solid‐state detector cooled by solid propane. A two‐pass technique had to be used with the scintillation detector because Compton background from the 1 779 keV photopeak of aluminum masked the manganese line. The Compton background did not interfere when the solid‐state detector was used. The borehole measurements compared favorably with a chemical core analysis and were unaffected by water in the borehole.",10.1190/1.1442075
"Past, Present, And Future Of Geophysical Inversion—A New Millennium Analysis","Geophysicists have been working on solutions to the inverse problem since the dawn of our profession. An interpreter infers subsurface properties on the basis of observed data sets, such as seismograms or potential field recordings. A rough model of the process that produces the recorded data resides within the interpreter's brain; the interpreter then uses this rough mental model to reconstruct subsurface properties from the observed data. In modern parlance, the inference of subsurface properties from observed data is identified with the solution of a so‐called ""inverse problem."" In contrast, the ""forward problem"" consists of the determination of the data that would be recorded for a given subsurface configuration and under the assumption that given laws of physics hold. Until the early 1960s, geophysical inversion was carried out almost exclusively within the geophysicist's brain. Since then, we have learned to make the geophysical inversion process much more quantitative and versatile by recourse to a growing body of theory, along with the computer power to reduce this theory to practice. We should point out the obvious, however, namely that no theory and no computer algorithm can presumably replace the ultimate arbiter who decides whether the results of an inversion make sense or nonsense: the geophysical interpreter. Perhaps our descendants writing a future third Millennium review article can report that a machine has been solving the inverse problem without a human arbiter. For the time being, however, what might be called ""unsupervised geophysical inversion"" remains but a dream.",10.1190/1.1444898
Migration Of Common‐Shot Gathers,"Three depth migration methods which operate on common‐shot data are presented. The first migration method maps digitized horizons from the X-T domain to the X-Z domain. Because this method is based on ray tracing, its computation time is short; it is suggested for iterative velocity analysis. The other two migration methods map the entire common‐shot gather into a depth section. The common‐shot migration requires calculation of the arrival time of the direct wave from the source to all the depth points, and is done through a direct solution of the eikonal equation. All three methods are suitable for areas with both lateral and vertical velocity variation.",10.1190/1.1442091
Electric Field Response Of Two‐Dimensional Inhomogeneities To Unipolar And Bipolar Electrode Configurations,"A quantitative comparative analysis of some bipolar and unipolar resistivity arrays is made in terms of perturbation effects due to buried lateral inhomogeneities. The Schlumberger, the collinear dipole‐dipole, the pole‐dipole, and the unipole electrode configurations of approximately the same dimensions are employed. A ""focusing effect"" in the vertical component of the current density distribution is demonstrated in the unipole configuration. Characteristic diagrams illustrating the configuration responses to lateral inhomogeneities located at different depths and under various overburden layer conductivities indicate that, for comparable geometric spreads, the unipole and the pole‐dipole configurations are significantly more effective.",10.1190/1.1440554
Ultralow‐Radiation‐Intensity Spectrometric Probe For Orebody Delineation And Grade Control Of Zinc‐Lead Ore,"A fully spectrometric gamma—gamma probe using an ultralow‐activity gamma‐ray source (i.e., 2 MBq) has been developed. The prototype low‐radiation‐intensity probe was tested at a zinc‐lead deposit in Queensland, Australia. The probe showed an excellent capability for orebody delineation. Lithological profiles derived from logging data showed sharp anomalies both in selected spectral regions and in spectral ratios during probe transition from orebody to barren rock, or vice versa. In comparison to standard geochemical analysis, the instrument demonstrated good potential for quantitative determination of lead and zinc content in ore with rms error of 0.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Delineation of nonlithological boundaries, through an application of a cutoff‐grade algorithm, has been demonstrated as a practical stand‐alone mine control tool.",10.1190/1.1444880
Parameter Nonuniqueness In Velocity Versus Depth Functions,"Except for hypothetical cases that are never encountered in practice, the solution for the parameters of analytic velocity versus depth functions is inherently nonunique. This nonuniqueness means that there is no particular parameter combination that represents ""the"" solution. The average discrepancy between the observed velocity‐depth (or time‐depth) curve and the calculated function curve gives a measure of the degree of fit between the two curves. In the parameter space, within a given degree of fit that may be considered as the margin of tolerance for the particular problem in hand, every parameter combination provides a valid solution. The solution trough is defined as the region in the parameter space containing these solutions. The shape of the solution trough depends on the relationship between the parameters and, therefore, on the form of the function being used. If the parameters are related linearly or if the relation is linearized then the axis of the solution trough is a straight line. The slope of the axis corresponds to a point close to the average depth of the interval to which the observed data pertain. The intercept corresponds to a velocity value that is quite close to the average velocity over the interval. These properties are extremely useful for understanding the nature of the solution trough in parameter space. Hence, composite displays of solution troughs pertaining to a number of wells can be interpreted to provide information on whether the unit to which the function corresponds has undergone any lateral changes. Such displays also illustrate how current practices that assume the existence of a unique or ""true"" solution need to be critically revised.",10.1190/1.1444203

Forward Modeling Of Gravity Data Using Geostatistically Generated Subsurface Density Variations,"Using geostatistical models of density variations in the subsurface, constrained by geologic data, forward models of gravity anomalies can be generated by discretizing the subsurface and calculating the cumulative effect of each cell (pixel). The results of such stochastically generated forward gravity anomalies can be compared with the observed gravity anomalies to find density models that match the observed data. These models have an advantage over forward gravity anomalies generated using polygonal bodies of homogeneous density because generating numerous realizations explores a larger region of the solution space. The stochastic modeling can be thought of as dividing the forward model into two components: that due to the shape of each geologic unit and that due to the heterogeneous distribution of density within each geologic unit. The modeling demonstrates that the internally heterogeneous distribution of density within each geologic unit can contribute significantly to the resulting calculated forward gravity anomaly. Furthermore, the stochastic models match observed statistical properties of geologic units, the solution space is more broadly explored by producing a suite of successful models, and the likelihood of a particular conceptual geologic model can be compared. The Vaca Fault near Travis Air Force Base, California, can be successfully modeled as a normal or strike-slip fault, with the normal fault model being slightly more probable. It can also be modeled as a reverse fault, although this structural geologic configuration is highly unlikely given the realizations we explored.",10.1190/geo2015-0663.1
Inversion Technique For Recovering The Elastic Constants Of Transversely Isotropic Materials,"A least‐squares iterative inversion technique has been developed for the determination of the elastic parameter δ* of any transversely isotropic modeling material in the laboratory. For most applications in petroleum geophysics, the elastic parameter δ* is very important and is the crucial anisotropic parameter for near‐vertical P‐wave propagation. Despite the potential importance of δ* in seismic exploration and for resolution in an anisotropic medium, the conventional procedures adopted in estimating its value unfortunately are faced with many ambiguities and the reliability of its measurement is doubtful prior to the development of this technique. The anisotropic inverse modeling technique finds the best fitting solution. To optimize the accuracy of the results presented in this paper, analytical rather than numerical differentiations were implemented and the modeling procedures allow for controlled iterative adjustments in resolving the parameter δ*. Inversion of the first‐arrival traveltimes obtained for vertical P‐waves through an anisotropic material known as phenolite yield estimates of the elastic parameter δ* as well as the vertical P‐wave velocity (α0) of the material. Accurate picking of the first‐arrival traveltimes is essential since δ* is found to be very sensitive to small differences between vertical and oblique traveltime picks. The inversion results have been found to be stable and convergent, and they also highlight the need for good angular coverage to determine the anisotropy parameters in materials suspected of being anisotropic.",10.1190/1.1444049
Carbonate Porosity From S/P Traveltime Ratios,"A twenty‐mile S‐wave seismic line was acquired on the northeastern shelf of the Anadarko basin by the 1977–1978 Conoco P‐Wave/S‐Wave Group Shoot. The resolution of the S‐wave section is at least as good as the resolution of a coincident P‐wave section acquired in 1975. The top and bottom of a collection of Paleozoic carbonates called the Hunton group can be identified on both sets of data. P and S traveltimes and traveltime ratios delineate lateral variations in the thickness and average porosity of the Hunton. Where the pore space is saturated with liquid, a systematic increase in average porosity from less than 2 percent to about 11 percent correlates with an increase in the S/P traveltime ratio from 1.84 to 1.96. The ratio decreases to values between 1.65 and 1.80 at two places along the line, probably indicating that the pore space is partially gas‐saturated at these locations. The data are consistent with the seismic response of a petrophysical model of the Hunton in which a majority of the pore shapes are elongated rather than round.",10.1190/1.1442247
